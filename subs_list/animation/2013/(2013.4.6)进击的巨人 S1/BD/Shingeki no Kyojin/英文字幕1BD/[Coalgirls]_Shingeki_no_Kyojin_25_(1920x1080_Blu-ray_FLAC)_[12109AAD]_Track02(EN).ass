A few days ago, the miner was swinging his small shovel in the coal mines when an idea suddenly \Npopped into his head: a comfortable life might be waiting for him within Wall Sina. It was an epiphany. After that, the miner spent \Ndays searching for a suitable excavation site until he found a densely growing forest along the wall. Nobody would pass by there, and \Nthe foliage above would likely shield his operation from view of the soldiers standing guard atop the wall. With these thoughts in \Nmind, he decided that the next night would be the time to act. The miner dug into the earth with his familiar broad shovel. The work \Nprogressed well. Before long, the hole was deeper than he was tall. To remove the dirt he dug up, he had to dump it into a cloth bag, \Nclimb up a ladder, and empty the bag outside. When he wasn't loosening his stiff muscles, he immersed himself with the digging, \Nbreaking occasionally to drink water. The miner had absolute confidence about the dig. He had been digging holes for twenty years \Nwithout rest. He had learned to dig deeper, faster, and more efficiently than others. Tunnels that others could not open were cleared \Neasily by this miner. But things were a little different that day. Hours passed, but there was no end in sight. He tested the hole's sides \N but to no avail. The wall's foundations were deeper yet. Even so, the miner never gave up. It wasn't because he was desperate to enter \NWall Sina and find a better life. No, the miner only felt an ambition to overcome the wall. "I swear on my twenty years of digging \Nholes—I shall conquer this wall." Such did the miner declare as he wiped away an endless stream of sweat. But after digging farther \Nthan four times his height, the miner's shovel struck solid bedrock. "Bedrock?" thought the miner. It appeared to be of the same \Ncomposition as the wall's own foundations. The miner struck it with all his strength. But the shovel broke without leaving a single \Nscratch. At last, the miner heaved a sigh that was deeper and greater than any hole he'd ever dug.
