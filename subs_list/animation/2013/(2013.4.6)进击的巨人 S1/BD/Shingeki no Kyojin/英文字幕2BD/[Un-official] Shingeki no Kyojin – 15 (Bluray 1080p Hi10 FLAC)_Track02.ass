Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.29,0:08:05.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Too bad you have no scent whatsoever.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.31,0:08:08.27,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll tell you when the time is right.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.98,0:08:20.10,Default,,0,0,0,,We'll probably be ordered to stand by for a few more days,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.10,0:08:24.44,Default,,0,0,0,,but I heard we're supposed to be going on a large-scale extramural expedition.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.44,0:08:28.69,Default,,0,0,0,,And we'll be taking the new graduates with us as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.69,0:08:30.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Is this true, Erd?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.88,0:08:32.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Isn't it awfully soon?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.00,0:08:37.95,Default,,0,0,0,,Even considering that they handled this last Titan attack quite well...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.28,0:08:41.72,Default,,0,0,0,,I heard those kids' pants required multiple washings to remove the shitstains.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.72,0:08:43.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Is this all true, Captain?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.12,0:08:46.79,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm not involved in making our plans.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.79,0:08:51.63,Default,,0,0,0,,It's Erwin. He's likely considering far more variables that might occur to us.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.63,0:08:56.02,Default,,0,0,0,,It's true that we're in an unprecedented situation.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.02,0:09:02.27,Default,,0,0,0,,On the one hand, we lost the Maria reconquest route that we established through huge sacrifices,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.27,0:09:05.35,Default,,0,0,0,,but on the other hand, we got an unexpected ray of hope.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.90,0:09:16.59,Default,,0,0,0,,I still have trouble believing it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.59,0:09:20.37,Default,,0,0,0,,You can "turn into a Titan", but what's that mean, Eren?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.20,0:09:25.01,Default,,0,0,0,,My memories from that time are quite hazy.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.01,0:09:27.52,Default,,0,0,0,,It felt like a selfless, dreaming state.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.52,0:09:30.91,Default,,0,0,0,,It can be triggered by hurting myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.91,0:09:32.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Like, if I bite—
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.62,0:09:37.36,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}Wait, how do I know this?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.32,0:09:40.59,Default,,0,0,0,,You guys know all of this too.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.59,0:09:43.45,Default,,0,0,0,,We couldn't get any more out of him than what's written in the reports.
