Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.54,0:08:33.12,Default,,0,0,0,,I can make the plans, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.24,0:08:38.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Eren, if there's something you don't understand, you must learn to comprehend it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.02,0:08:43.44,Default,,0,0,0,,It's more than worth risking our lives for.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.74,0:08:49.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Can we get started soon, Eren?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.28,0:08:53.64,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll fire a signal flare for you when we're ready.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.85,0:08:56.31,Default,,0,0,0,,After that, whatever you do is your call.
