Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.88,0:07:35.93,Default,,0,0,0,,a spy managed to slip in amongst us.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.16,0:07:38.57,Default,,0,0,0,,And he narrowed down the possibilities from there.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.03,0:07:42.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Then, this spy killed Sawney and Bean?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.82,0:07:48.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Back then, the Commander asked me about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.55,0:07:52.24,Default,,0,0,0,,What do you see?
