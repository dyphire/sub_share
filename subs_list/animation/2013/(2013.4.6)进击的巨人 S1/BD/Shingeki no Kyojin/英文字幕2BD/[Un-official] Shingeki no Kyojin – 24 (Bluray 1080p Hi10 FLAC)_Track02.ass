Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.77,0:09:06.15,Default,,0,0,0,,Not to mention, she reacted when I referred to how you "sought to die so soon,"
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.47,0:09:09.07,Default,,0,0,0,,which nobody outside the 104th would understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.44,0:09:15.73,Default,,0,0,0,,And mostly because I'm pretty sure she killed Sawney and Bean, the two experimental subjects.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.38,0:09:19.70,Default,,0,0,0,,But why?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.70,0:09:23.74,Default,,0,0,0,,One would need quite the skill to kill those two.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.74,0:09:27.19,Default,,0,0,0,,The culprit would've used their own 3D Maneuver Gear, since they'd be accustomed to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.14,0:09:32.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So that's why we had a gear check? But Annie wasn't caught.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.88,0:09:36.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Because she brought Marco's to the check.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.95,0:09:39.68,Default,,0,0,0,,That's how she passed.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.15,0:09:46.52,Default,,0,0,0,,What? What does Marco have to do with this?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.32,0:09:48.77,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.40,0:09:51.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Are you sure you're not mistaken?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.06,0:09:53.50,Default,,0,0,0,,No, I'm pretty certain.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.50,0:09:58.28,Default,,0,0,0,,I got that, kid. Do you have any other evidence?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.53,0:10:00.27,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.27,0:10:03.87,Default,,0,0,0,,In my opinion, the female-form resembles Annie.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.87,0:10:05.79,Default,,0,0,0,,What? What are you even saying?!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.10,0:10:07.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Is that all you—
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.69,0:10:10.13,Default,,0,0,0,,So we've got no proof, but we'll still do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.69,0:10:12.72,Default,,0,0,0,,No proof?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.72,0:10:15.48,Default,,0,0,0,,What? Then why?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.48,0:10:17.57,Default,,0,0,0,,What if it isn't Annie?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.57,0:10:20.99,Default,,0,0,0,,If it's not Annie, then she'll be cleared of suspicion.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.67,0:10:24.74,Default,,0,0,0,,True, we'll have put her through a terrible ordeal.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.74,0:10:31.02,Default,,0,0,0,,But if we do nothing, you'll be sacrificed to Central's whims.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.71,0:10:34.44,Default,,0,0,0,,It's just not right to doubt Annie..
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.44,0:10:38.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Eren, after hearing that it might be Annie, has anything come to mind?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.86,0:10:50.75,Default,,0,0,0,,You fought the female-form in hand-to-hand combat.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.01,0:10:54.41,Default,,0,0,0,,Did she use any of Annie's typical moves?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.36,0:11:20.27,Default,,0,0,0,,You know it too. Annie {\i1}is{\i0} the female-form Titan.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.13,0:11:27.31,Default,,0,0,0,,So why aren't you fighting?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:28.50,0:11:33.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Are other feelings holding you back?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.42,0:11:34.84,Default,,0,0,0,,What?!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.60,0:11:41.13,Default,,0,0,0,,I've got a plan!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.35,0:11:46.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Mikasa and I will exit that hole and the entrance at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.59,0:11:49.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Annie will have to follow one of us.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.52,0:11:52.65,Default,,0,0,0,,That should buy you time to run the other way!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:52.96,0:11:54.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Wait!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:54.57,0:11:57.30,Default,,0,0,0,,That means one of you is going to die!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.30,0:11:59.44,Default,,0,0,0,,If we keep sitting here, it'll be all three of us!
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.20,0:12:02.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Mikasa! On my mark!
