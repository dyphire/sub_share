Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.63,0:05:32.44,Default,,0,0,0,,They say that before the Titans took control of the land,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.44,0:05:39.18,Default,,0,0,0,,men were endlessly fighting and killing each \Nother over their differing loyalties and beliefs.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.11,0:05:43.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Back then, someone supposedly said:

Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.95,0:05:51.62,Default,,0,0,0,,humanity would probably unite and stop fighting among themselves."

Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.48,0:05:57.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Such a fairy tale exists?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.16,0:06:00.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Sounds awfully optimistic.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.13,0:06:01.82,Default,,0,0,0,,Frankly, it's rather dull.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.70,0:06:07.26,Default,,0,0,0,,You're just like me. Your opinion's quite twisted.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.26,0:06:11.83,Default,,0,0,0,,That's because even now, though we've been cornered by such a mighty foe,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.83,0:06:14.89,Default,,0,0,0,,I would say that mankind's still far from united.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.52,0:06:18.91,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah. But if we don't all come together soon,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.91,0:06:21.80,Default,,0,0,0,,keeping up the fight might be too much for us.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.91,0:06:30.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Eren?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.41,0:06:33.20,Default,,0,0,0,,So he's safe...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.54,0:06:41.29,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}"Focus on your own mission." That's some attitude he's got towards his superior.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.29,0:06:45.38,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}Judging from his demeanor, Mikasa and Armin must be okay too.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.36,0:06:50.47,Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}But why is he by the Commander's side?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.83,0:06:59.53,Default,,0,0,0,,Want some?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.94,0:07:01.19,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll gladly accept.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.21,0:07:12.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Kill me! If you want to execute me, hurry up!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.36,0:07:14.78,Default,,0,0,0,,If you want to die that badly!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.88,0:07:24.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Attention!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.03,0:07:35.64,Default,,0,0,0,,I will now brief you about the operation for retaking Trost!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.32,0:07:42.51,Default,,0,0,0,,The goal of this operation is to block the shattered gate!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.78,0:07:51.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Block it? How?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.92,0:07:54.08,Default,,0,0,0,,As for the means of blocking it,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.08,0:07:56.67,Default,,0,0,0,,I shall now introduce him.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.08,0:08:01.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Eren Jaeger of the Cadets!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.05,0:08:04.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Eren?!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.28,0:08:10.85,Default,,0,0,0,,He's the product of the military's top secret Titan transformation experiments!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.36,0:08:17.42,Default,,0,0,0,,He can summon a Titan body and control it at will!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.43,0:08:23.14,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't really get what the Commander just said.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.14,0:08:25.48,Default,,0,0,0,,It's not because I'm stupid, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.48,0:08:27.82,Default,,0,0,0,,Shut up, stupid.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.01,0:08:34.00,Default,,0,0,0,,He will transform into a Titan, pick up that giant boulder near the front gate,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.00,0:08:37.53,Default,,0,0,0,,carry it to the breach in the wall, and block off the hole with it!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.65,0:08:46.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Your mission will be to protect him from the other Titans while he's carrying the boulder!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.48,0:08:49.63,Default,,0,0,0,,So we wouldn't need to engage the Titans?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.63,0:08:54.39,Default,,0,0,0,,S-Sorry for interrupting, even though I'm just a Cadet...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.39,0:08:56.53,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't care. Continue.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.53,0:08:57.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, sir.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.89,0:09:02.39,Default,,0,0,0,,The Titans tend to focus on and attack larger groups of humans.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.05,0:09:07.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Taking advantage of that, we can lure them away from the gate to the inner wall.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.76,0:09:12.90,Default,,0,0,0,,That way, we could draw most of them away from Eren without any direct confrontation.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.90,0:09:19.41,Default,,0,0,0,,After they're gathered there, we can use the cannons to eliminate them without losses.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.41,0:09:23.54,Default,,0,0,0,,However, we can't leave Eren defenseless.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.54,0:09:27.17,Default,,0,0,0,,A small, select group should protect him.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.17,0:09:31.61,Default,,0,0,0,,We can't avoid fighting any new Titans that may enter through the hole.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.61,0:09:34.69,Default,,0,0,0,,We'll have to depend on the skill of the elites for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.69,0:09:37.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Very well. Let's revise the strategy based on those points.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.89,0:09:44.68,Default,,0,0,0,,However, this plan is predicated on the idea that Eren can and will carry the boulder and block the hole.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.68,0:09:51.44,Default,,0,0,0,,I can't help but feel uneasy about executing an \Noperation that hinges on such an untested assumption.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.44,0:09:54.86,Default,,0,0,0,,That's true. The very core of this strategy is uncertain.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.86,0:09:59.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course I have qualms about putting so many lives in jeopardy on that basis.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.52,0:10:02.58,Default,,0,0,0,,But I also get where Commander Pixis is coming from.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.58,0:10:04.95,Default,,0,0,0,,Foremost is the issue of time.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.81,0:10:09.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Titans are still spilling through the gap even as we speak.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.25,0:10:15.10,Default,,0,0,0,,The more Titans are in the town, the lower our chances of successfully retaking it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.10,0:10:20.05,Default,,0,0,0,,Not to mention the probability of Wall Rose falling increases.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.61,0:10:22.27,Default,,0,0,0,,There's another issue too.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.05,0:10:28.58,Default,,0,0,0,,There's a limit to how far people can be pushed ahead by fear alone.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.96,0:10:33.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Pick up that giant boulder?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.36,0:10:38.31,Default,,0,0,0,,So mankind can control the Titans now?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.74,0:10:39.85,Default,,0,0,0,,You lie!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.85,0:10:43.28,Default,,0,0,0,,I won't throw away my life for such nonsense!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.28,0:10:49.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Who do you think we are?! We're not just disposable blades!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.12,0:10:51.65,Default,,0,0,0,,A human weapon, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.65,0:10:53.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course it's not true!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.21,0:10:53.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Damn the liars!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.96,0:10:56.20,Default,,0,0,0,,So you want us to die for you today?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.20,0:10:57.58,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm leaving!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.72,0:11:02.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Me too!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.30,0:11:03.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Me too!

Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.22,0:11:06.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Stop!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.12,0:11:07.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you want to be executed?!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.81,0:11:11.93,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm gonna spend the last days of mankind with my family!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.48,0:11:14.08,Default,,0,0,0,,This is bad.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:14.08,0:11:15.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.00,0:11:17.38,Default,,0,0,0,,Order is falling apart.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.11,0:11:20.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Are you prepared, deserters?!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.03,0:11:23.73,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll cut you all down here and now!
