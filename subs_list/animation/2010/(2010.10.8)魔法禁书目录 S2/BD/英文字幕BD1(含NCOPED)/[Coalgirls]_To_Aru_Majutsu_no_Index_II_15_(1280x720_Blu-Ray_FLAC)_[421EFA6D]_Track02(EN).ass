Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.86,0:01:30.44,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I've never heard of such a thing.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.06,0:01:42.45,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Is this fleet really only for surveillance?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.45,0:01:45.71,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Maybe you literally got caught by our surveillance then.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.84,0:01:51.01,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You {\i1}are{\i0}  the people who ruined the Roman Catholics Church's plans.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.01,0:01:55.65,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,On top of that, one of you is Japanese and another is from London.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.09,0:01:58.53,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, that's just a cover-up, anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.53,0:02:00.47,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,This is like a labor facility.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.39,0:02:06.75,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,They gather criminals, such as myself, and have them repay their debts.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.26,0:02:12.98,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So the people aboard this ship are mainly my squad, or rather, my former squad members.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.75,0:02:31.11,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Those two used a spell which confuses the security system, allowing them to break out.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.75,0:02:36.91,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,They were planning on coming back to get the rest of us, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.43,0:02:47.46,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So they were brought back and are in even more trouble now?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.00,0:02:50.60,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I think they're fixing the spell they cast.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.66,0:02:55.52,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,They're probably being modified so they can never use it again.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.52,0:02:56.19,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Modified?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.19,0:03:00.57,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you mean they're making cognitive thought impossible?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.57,0:03:03.31,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,In other words, destroying their brain structure?

Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.42,0:03:09.75,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That's my only request.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.75,0:03:12.30,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,That way we can get the jailbreak spell too.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.30,0:03:17.05,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But doesn't the Roman Catholic Church already know of the spell?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.05,0:03:20.20,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The Queen's Fleet has a huge job to do right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.20,0:03:22.99,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,They don't have the time to be worrying about one or two escapees.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.37,0:03:37.42,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Let's get out of here together.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.29,0:03:42.01,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,The supervisors are afraid of a riot breaking out.{mutiny}
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.40,0:03:43.32,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Let me put it this way:
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.32,0:03:47.12,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm trying to prevent that from happening.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.55,0:03:50.77,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I have the right to move freely throughout the fleet.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.77,0:03:52.86,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And I don't have to work, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.86,0:03:55.31,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,This place is actually kind of comfortable for me.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.19,0:03:59.60,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Sister Lucia and Angelene are both getting nowhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.57,0:04:03.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,They should have just left us behind...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.76,0:04:06.76,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If, by any chance, you escape successfully,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.76,0:04:09.70,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,you will no longer be involved with the Roman Catholic Church's activities.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.43,0:04:11.79,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.79,0:04:15.17,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But with just us two versus everyone here, there's little chance we'll be able to save them.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.30,0:04:20.84,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,This is coming from the man who stood up against an an entire army of Sisters?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.26,0:04:25.67,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,T-Thanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.62,0:04:42.35,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So those clothes were altered with a spell, limiting you from using magic!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.51,0:04:52.45,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If that was The Queen's Fleet, I can't do anything alone.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.33,0:05:14.10,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Get back, Orsola!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.59,0:05:28.22,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Looks like that armor was some kind of magic construct.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.22,0:05:32.06,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Yes. It appears to be a part of the ship, just in a different form.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.05,0:05:40.81,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't move!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.35,0:05:46.47,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,How do you think we broke this?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.47,0:05:47.27,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Oh, my.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.27,0:05:49.86,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I didn't mean to say that in Japanese.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.86,0:05:50.93,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,But you understood me, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.68,0:05:55.49,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,If you won't heed our warning, we'll just have to use this.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.48,0:06:00.71,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,We came to rescue you.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.71,0:06:04.36,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you really think we can believe that?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.36,0:06:05.28,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,You see...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.98,0:06:11.89,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,According to Agnese, you two had a spell that could get us out of here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.89,0:06:14.62,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,She told us to work with you to escape.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.62,0:06:16.89,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,S-Sister Agnese told you that?!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.94,0:06:20.19,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Use your brain! This could be a trap!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.19,0:06:22.27,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,From our point of view, this is enemy territory.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.27,0:06:28.65,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Why would we go as far as to use Agnese's name?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.47,0:06:32.37,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Sister Lucia...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.06,0:06:38.81,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,I understand. I guess I can trust you this one time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.40,0:06:42.29,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,So, how do we get out?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.16,0:06:44.80,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,It's too much trouble to explain it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.80,0:06:46.27,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Sister Angelene.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.27,0:06:56.06,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Wow...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.06,0:07:00.57,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,By modifying the spell that turns these ships into ice, we can easily create a hole.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.57,0:07:05.31,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,We can utilize this to harden sea water into a small pod.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.41,0:07:08.23,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,What's wrong?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.23,0:07:13.47,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,They added an countermagic spell to our clothes, too...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.89,0:07:53.45,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,What's going to happen to us now?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.45,0:07:54.68,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Rather...

Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.67,0:08:15.91,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,And the bath's lukewarm, not hot.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.91,0:08:18.11,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Really?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.11,0:08:21.73,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,Well it's true that the adults don't seem to care much...
