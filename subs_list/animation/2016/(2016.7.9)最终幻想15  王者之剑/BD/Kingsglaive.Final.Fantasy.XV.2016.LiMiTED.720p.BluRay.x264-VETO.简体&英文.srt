Lucis isn't paying us refugees enough...

47
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,300
就给我们这点儿钱

00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,750
所有分队，撤回提取点 支援回程

尼克斯！ 我们必须离开这里

69
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,270

70
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,440
救命！
Help!

71
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600

那个笨蛋
That idiot.

73
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,780
尼克斯！
Nyx!

74
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,910
克劳 我们得走了
Crowe. We gotta move.

75
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,080
你在开玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding me.

76
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,690
你知道我最受不了这个
You know I ain't got the stomach for this crap.

77
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,990
你能走吗？
Would you rather walk?

78
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,150
快 就像是家乡的加拉哈峡谷
Come on. Just like Galahd Canyon back home.

79
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,710
利波特斯！

皇室部队看来正在撤退 长官

Guess I owe you another one.

83
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,210
我会把它放在你的标签上的
I'll put it on your tab.

84
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,590
你好好休息吧 好吗？
You just try and get some rest, all right?

85
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,030
你抵抗了撤退的命令
You disobeyed a direct order to retreat.

86
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,110
为了家园 是吗，长官？
For hearth and home, right, sir?

87
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,000
只要我还有一口气 我就会谨遵命令
As long as I got strength in my body, I obey that order.

88
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,960
别傻了 尼克斯·乌尔里克
Don't fool yourself, Nyx Ulric.

89
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,430
无论你有何种力量 都是来自于国王的
Whatever strength you have is on loan from the king.

90
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,430
没有他 你一无是处
You are nothing without him.

91
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,220
等候你的处理安排吧
Await details of your reassignment.

92
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,450
是的 陛下
Yes, Your Majesty.

93
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,040
尽管敌人获得了胜利
Despite their victory all but assured.

94
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,050
一次突然而且莫名其妙的撤退
A sudden and inexplicable retreat.

95
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,800
我们依然置身于危险之中 陛下
We are at risk nonetheless, Your Majesty.

96
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,760
我们不知道他们什么时候会回击
We cannot know when they will strike again.

97
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,600
陛下 西门有消息
Your Majesty, word from the West Gate.

98
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,650
一名自称是敌国使者的人 请求见您
A man claiming to be an envoy of the empire requests an audience.

99
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,560

100
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,910
您好

00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,190
您好！
Hello!

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,620
很高兴见到您…
Good day to you...

103
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
还有您
...and you.

104
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,370
很高兴见到你 路西斯人们
Well met, my dear Lucians.

105
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,330
尼夫海姆竟然如此毫无顾虑…
Has Niflheim grown so bold...

106
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,790
派他们的宰相亲自做使者？
...that they send the chancellor himself as envoy?

107
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,290
而且只身一人前来？
And under no guard, at that?

108
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,510
能被伟大的雷吉斯国王认出来 真是我的荣幸
It is an honor to be recognized by the great King Regis.

109
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,440
而且允许我站在大堂之上 做自我介绍
Yet permit me to stand on ceremony and introduce myself nonetheless.

110
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,480
我是阿登·伊祖尼亚 尼夫海姆的宰相…
Ardyn Izunia, Chancellor of Niflheim...

111
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,530
愿意为您效劳
...at your humble service.

112
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,780
我在最吉利的日子来拜访您…
And I come to you on this...

113
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,450
是为了呈上和平协议
...most auspicious of days to offer terms of peace.

114
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,400
和平？
Peace?

115
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,040
您肯定猜到了…
As you no doubt surmised...

116
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,660
我们最近的作战方案 并不是有计谋的撤退
...that recent maneuver of ours was no strategic retreat.

117
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,050
请叫它…
Call it...

118
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,000
一次邻国的示好
...a gesture of imperial goodwill.

119
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,970
正如你一样 我们最大的希望就是…
Like you, we wish nothing more...

120
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,880
为这场豪无意义的战争画上句号
...than to bring a swift end to this senseless war.

121
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,980
果真如此吗？
Is that so?

122
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,180
千真万确
It is, indeed.

123
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,570
但是我们要求你们完全的顺服
And we require but a singular compliance.

124
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,070
为了拯救你们的王都因索莫尼亚
Save your grand Insomnia here.

125
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,770
路西斯必须割让所有的领土
Lucis must forfeit all territories to Niflheim rule.

126
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,540
因索莫尼亚！
Insomnia!

127
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,450
路西斯王国皇冠上的明珠
The jewel in the crown of the Lucian kingdom.

128
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,420
对了 我怎么能够忘记
How foolish of me to forget.

129
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,800
还有一件小事
There is just one more trivial thing.

130
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,330
有关于您的儿子
It concerns your son.

131
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,460
路西斯王国的王子诺克提斯…
The fetching Prince Noctis of Lucis...

132
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,350
还有戴涅布莱国的美丽公主 露娜弗雷亚…
...and the fair Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae....

133
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,730
他们要结为夫妇
They are to be wed.

134
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,400
您看起来很苦恼 尊敬的陛下
You seem vexed, Your Highness.

135
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,900
我向您保证 公主一直以来都敬重您…
I assure you, the princess still holds you in the highest regard...

136
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,440
这十二年来一向如此
...as she has done all these 12 long years.

137
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,540
不知道有没有人告诉你…
Don't know if anyone's told you...

138
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,470
但是我们从来不容忍 不服从命令的人
...but we don't take kindly to insubordination around here.

139
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,110
你自己好好看看吧
Do yourself a favor, take a look around.

140
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,180
这就是百年和平的景象
This is what a hundred years of peace looks like.

141
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:25,650
这种和平仅仅靠着一堵墙维持
It's a lasting peace made by the Wall and the Wall alone.

142
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,780
看见了吧 我们不需要你们这些外来移民…
See, we don't need any of you immigrants...

143
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,410
上蹿下跳 充英雄
...jumping around, playing war hero.

144
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,490
嘿！ 今天一战不顺利吧，剑员？
Hey! Rough day on the gate, huh, Glaive?

145
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,530
你这个混蛋 是你害的我们被困在那儿
You jerk. It's your fault he got stuck there.

146
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,630
-这样欢迎大英雄可不好 -你这一身装扮也不好
-Not a very nice welcome for a big hero. -Not a very nice outfit for one, either.

147
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,430
这样穿能突出我的眼睛
I think it brings out my eyes.

148
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,180
这里面放了什么东西？
What'd you put in this?

149
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,670
吃起来就像是陆行鸟的大便
Tastes like a chocobo turd.

150
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,060
闭上你的臭嘴！
Hey, shut your trap!

151
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,360
这儿可不是加拉哈 我们这儿的人都喜欢这个
This ain't Galahd. That's the way folks around here like it.

152
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,360
好吧，我真高兴看到你 情愿出卖我们的传统，只为多赚点钱
Oh, well. I'm glad to see you're willing to sell out our heritage for a few extra gil.

153
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,650
利波特斯 你感谢尼克斯的救命之恩了吗？
Hey, Libertus. You thank Nyx for saving your life yet?

154
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,990
得了吧，克劳 我和尼克斯谁跟谁呀
Oh, come on, Crowe. Nyx and I are too close for that.

155
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,780
他帮我，我帮他 一向如此
He helps me, I help him. That's the way it's always been.

156
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,500
看来你从别的地方获得帮助了 是吗？
Looks like you got a little help from something else, huh?

157
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,210
我需要所有可能的帮助
I need all I can get.

158
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,410
为了温暖！
For hearth!

159
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,800
-还有家园 -还有家园
-And home. -And home.

160
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,380
尼克斯，新任看门人 新工作怎么样？
So, Nyx the Gatekeeper. How's the new post treating you?

161
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,600
简直棒极了 你们肯定会喜欢的
Oh, it's amazing. You guys would love it.

162
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,750
看大门真是太棒了
The gate watch are real sweethearts.

163
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,670
是的 没错
Yeah, right.

164
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,440
我们都知道 他们恨我们这些外来人胜过一切
We all know they hate us outsiders more than anything.

165
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,770
他们除了恨我们 没有事情做
So bored they got nothing better to do.

166
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,480
无聊也没那么糟
Boredom's not so bad.

167
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,010
至少意味着和平
Means there's peace, at least.

168
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,110
为了了解无聊的感受 我愿意为加拉哈人民再战上百次
I'd fight a hundred more wars for Galahdans to know boredom.

169
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,980
随便你
Fight all you want.

170
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,490
只是不要把命丢了
Just don't go dying yet.

171
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,270
我还是欠你的
I still owe you.

172
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
欠你很多
A lot.

173
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,650
王者之剑没有了英雄 该何去何从呢？
Where would the Glaive be without its hero?

174
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,570
我们喝酒的时候 你能不能别说这些？
Can you not talk like this while we're drinking, please?

175
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,910
我们刚刚把敌人打得落花流水 不是吗？
We just sent the Niffs running with tails between their legs, right?

176
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,830
他们并不是逃跑了 他们只是在耍我们
They weren't running from us. No, they were toying with us.

177
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,250
别这么扫兴，卢彻 我们都知道发生了什么
Stop being such a buzzkill, Luche. We all know what happened.

178
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,180
你们知道他们派出了使者 来到堡垒吗？
Did you know they sent an envoy to the Citadel after that?

179
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,840
为了什么？ 向我们投降吗？
What for? To offer their surrender?

180
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,340
-更像是命令我们 -什么？
-More like demand ours. -What?

181
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,510
命令？ 去他们的！
Demand? My ass!

182
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,510
不可思议吗？ 好好想想吧
No? Think about it.

183
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,850
敌人已经把路西斯逼到了绝境
The empire's got Lucis on its last legs.

184
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,150
现在正是发出命令的绝佳时机
It's the perfect time to make demands.

185
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,860
我们输定了 陛下
We are losing this war, Your Majesty.

186
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,440
路西斯不能光靠王者之剑
Lucis cannot rely on the Kingsglaive alone.

187
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,740
接受停战协议会是我们最好的选择
Accepting the truce may be our best course of action.

188
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,460
你这样说完全忘记了我们的新墙
You speak of matters beyond the New Wall.

189
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,460
只要新墙还在 我们就不需要什么停战协议
We have no need of a truce here, so long as it stands.

190
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,080
即使处境变得更糟 我们还有旧墙
And if our position worsens, we still have the Old Wall.

191
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,290
是的 但是停战协议可以停止一切战争
Yes, but this truce will end the fighting altogether.

192
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,520
如果我们肯妥协…
If only we could compromise--

193
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,600
妥协是不明智的
Compromise is unwise.

194
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,590
我们不知道尼夫海姆的真正动机
We know nothing of Niflheim's true intentions.

195
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,980
别傻了 城墙远非坚不可摧
Do not fool yourselves. The Walls are far from impenetrable.

196
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,450
我们的选择所剩无几
The paths left to us are few.

197
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,820
新墙从王座上吸取力量
The New Wall draws its power from the throne.

198
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,870
如果国家需要 我还可以再支撑它几年
I am able to sustain it for some years yet, if the kingdom requires it.

199
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,130
但是敌国丞相说了一件事实
But the chancellor spoke one truth, if only one.

200
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,260
我们都老了 旧城墙也…
We are old, and the Old Wall....

201
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,500
我不能以一只虚弱的手来指挥旧墙…
I cannot command the Old Wall with a weakened hand...

202
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,090
我也没有力量再掀起反攻的战斗了
...nor do I have the strength to muster an offensive to turn the tide on this war.

203
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,020
请做出最后决定吧 陛下
Then let the choice be made, Your Majesty.

204
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,050
我们要做什么？
What are we to protect?

205
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,500
救命 母亲！
Help Mother!

206
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,180
你为什么从来没有这样不走运过？
How come you never lose your lunch like that?

207
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,060
这些都讲不通
Just doesn't add up.

208
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,530
这是一种古老的艺术 是皇室的秘密
Here's this ancient art, secret of the royal family and all that.

209
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,080
利波特斯！ 尼克斯！
Libertus! Nyx!

210
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,620
你们都过来 瞧瞧这个
Come here, guys, you gotta see this.

211
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,370
今天的国会显得很忙碌…
Things were hectic in the capital today...

212
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,290
因为路西斯政府宣布完全接受…
...as the Lucian government announced full acceptance...

213
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,290
被某些人批评为单方面的…
...of what some are criticizing as the unilateral peace terms...

214
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,510
由尼夫海姆宰相 伊祖尼亚提出的和平条件
...proposed by Chancellor Izunia of Niflheim.

215
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,970
停战协议规定 路西斯的所有领土…
The signing of the truce will see power over all Lucian territories...

216
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,390
将归尼夫海姆帝国统治 除了王都因索莫尼亚
...transferred to the empire, with the sole exception of Insomnia.

217
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,930
作为交换，尼夫海姆保证 因索莫尼亚及其居民的安全…
In return, Niflheim guarantees the safety of Insomnia and its citizenry...

218
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,310
以及停止一切敌对行为…
...as well as a cessation to all hostilities...

219
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,390
为这场旷日持久的战争画上句号
...bringing a decisive end to this long and bitter war.

220
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,020
我们参加的所有战斗 一切都是徒劳无功
All that fighting we did. All for nothing.

221
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,160
队员们 报告室集合
Glaives. Assemble in the briefing room.

222
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,580
马上
Now.

223
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,090
国王已经发言 你们也已经听到了
The king has spoken, and you have heard.

224
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,800
所有城墙之外的领地 都将割让给尼夫海姆帝国
All lands beyond the Wall are to be relinquished to the empire.

225
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,880
没有幸存的领地吗？
Will no regions be spared?

226
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,890
-没有 -但是你的家乡也在其中呀！
-None. -But your home's out there too!

227
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
我知道
It is.

228
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,100
国王为什么这么做？
Why would the king do this?

229
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,050
因为这样可以结束该死的战争
Because it'll end this damn war.

230
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,610
-克劳 -长官！
-Crowe. -Sir!

231
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,940
做好准备 你要潜入戴涅布莱国
Prepare to deploy. You're being sent to infiltrate Tenebrae.

232
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,600
戴涅布莱国 长官？
Tenebrae, sir?

233
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,280
任务细节属于机密
Mission details are classified.

234
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,020
三十分钟后 到我的办公室接受任务…
Report to my office for briefing in 30 minutes.

235
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,620
还有 尼克斯…
And, Nyx....

236
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,570
你不用再守城门了
You're off the West Gate.

237
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,500
你被重新调回堡垒守卫
You've been reassigned to the castle guard.

238
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,750
就这些
That is all.

239
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,040
这就是你要说的吗 卢彻？
So this is what you were talking about, Luche?

240
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,300
你听到长官说的了
You heard the captain.

241
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,640
-这又不是我们能决定的 -我们不能决定？
-This wasn't our decision to make. -Not ours to make?

242
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,390
那里是我们的家园！ 我们的亲人！
Those are our homes out there! Our people!

243
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,020
你不会就这样抛弃他们吧？
You're just gonna go along and abandon them?

244
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,720
如果我们不妥协…
If we don't go along with them...

245
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,140
尼夫海姆帝国就会把 因索莫尼亚变成地狱
...the empire will unleash all hell on Insomnia.

246
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,690
-那我们就把他们也扔进地狱！ -别激动，别激动
-We'll unleash it right back at them! -Easy, easy.

247
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,070
他不是敌人
He's not the enemy.

248
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,780
你不明白吗？
Don't you get it?

249
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,190
我们对他们来说 不值一提
We're nothing to them.

250
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,960
胆小如鼠 躲在城墙后面
Rats, snuck in from beyond the Wall.

251
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,820
当然了 他们会利用我们…
Sure, they had a use for us...

252
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,170
因为他们觉得我们可以使用魔法
...when they realized we could work their magic.

253
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,080
所以他们把我们 从那些老鼠当中挑出来…
So they handpicked us from all the other rats out there...

254
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,040
让我们蚕食他宝贵的皇室能力
...and just let us nibble away at his royal majesty's precious power.

255
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,790
但是一旦战争结束…
But as soon as this war's all over...

256
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,380
我们就要回到下水道了
...it's back to the sewers for all of us.

257
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,470
连你也是 英雄
That means you too, hero.

258
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,430
你那么想家，利波特斯 为什么不和尼克斯一起回去呢？
You missing home so much, Libertus, why don't you and Nyx head on back?

259
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,020
我肯定尼夫海姆会张开双臂欢迎你的
I'm sure Niflheim will welcome you with open arms.

260
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,240
你的家乡也在那儿
You've got a home out there too.

261
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,870
还是说你已经忘了？
Or did you forget?

262
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,130
该死！
Damn it!

263
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,880
我不会袖手旁观的
I'm not gonna let it end like this.

264
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,250
据说民众的情绪很好 陛下
It is said sentiment amongst the people is favorable, Your Majesty.

265
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,680
大部分人都欢迎这样的和平
Most all will welcome this peace.

266
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,440
如果你没有亲耳听到他们的声音…
If you yourself have not heard their voices...

267
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,980
你怎么能知道他们的真实想法？
...how can you claim to know their hearts?

268
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,070
去戴涅布莱国的任务怎么办 陛下？
What of the mission to Tenebrae, Your Majesty?

269
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,520
这样的秘密行动是否明智？
Is such clandestine action wise?

270
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,600
如果被发现 这只会激起尼夫海姆帝国的不满
If discovered, it will only serve to provoke the empire.

271
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,950
在合约签署之前 尼夫海姆帝国一直是我们的敌人
The empire remains our enemy until the treaty is signed.

272
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,700
只要我们还在战争中…
So long as we are at war...

273
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,900
陛下就坚持要领先一步
...His Majesty intends to remain one step ahead of them.

274
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,500
当然
Of course.

275
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,500
发卡？ 我觉得你应该不喜欢这种东西
A hairpin? I didn't think you were into that kind of thing.

276
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,470
不是给我的 是给公主的礼物
It's not for me. It's a gift for the princess.

277
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,980
但是不要张扬 要保密
But keep that quiet. Nobody's supposed to know.

278
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,300
是叫我的
Well, that's me.

279
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,720
多加小心
Watch your back out there.

280
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,190
我知道你不喜欢听 但是你就像一个…
I know you're sick of hearing it, but you're like a little--

281
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,820
你的小妹妹 我知道，我都听烦了
Little sister to you. Yeah, I am sick of hearing it.

282
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,150
要保证完完整整地回来 好吗？
Just make sure you come back in one piece, all right?

283
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,420
你都不是一个完整的人
Says the guy in two pieces.

284
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,930
{\an8}（戴涅布莱国的曾经属地）

285
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,900
露娜弗雷亚公主 我把后门打开了
Lady Lunafreya, I have left the rear gate open.

286
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
谢谢你
Thank you.

287
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,190
你必须要走吗？
Must you go?

288
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
是的
Yes.

289
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,540
那就快一点儿
Then go quickly.

290
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,300
我记得我没有允许过你离开这里 露娜弗雷亚
I do not recall granting you permission to leave your quarters, Lunafreya.

291
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,290
雷夫斯
Ravus.

292
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,760
在去路西斯之前 你不准再离开这个房间
You are not to leave this room again until the journey to Lucis.

293
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,600
这是为了你好
It is for your own good.

294
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,930
为了我？
My own good?

295
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,310
到底发生了什么？
What is truly going on here?

296
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,600
尼夫海姆帝国逼我和诺克提斯结婚 有什么用意？
What cause does the empire have to see me wed to Noctis?

297
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,140
他们要和解 而你们的联姻就是橄榄枝
They have offered a peace, and your marriage is the olive branch.

298
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,230
你想要我相信吗？
You expect me to believe that?

299
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,440
我不在乎你信不信
What you believe does not concern me.

300
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,080
我在乎的是 你偷偷溜出去…
What does concern me is you sneaking off...

301
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,320
告诉你母亲的杀手 一些你自己编造的故事
...to go tell our mother's killer about some plot you've dreamt up.

302
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,960
你憎恨雷吉斯国王是不对的
You are wrong to hate King Regis.

303
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,420
是尼夫海姆杀了母亲 不是他
Niflheim killed Mother, not him.

304
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,340
他们杀了母亲 让你成了他们的哈趴狗
They murdered her and made you their lapdog.

305
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,620
完毕
It's done.

306
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,410
在等待停战的期待当中 喜悦的气氛已经风靡全城…
An air of jubilation has swept the city in anticipation of the coming armistice.

307
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,070
在和平协议正式生效前 仅仅只剩三天时间了…
With only three days remaining until the peace is officially signed into effect...

308
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,360
居民们踊跃的走上街头 表示…
...throngs of citizens have taken to the streets to show....

309
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,380
{\an8}（-路西斯退出 -尼夫海姆袭击加哈拉）

310
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,250
{\an8}（和平协定 三天后生效）

311
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,920
路西斯需要你们 年轻的战士们
Lucis needs your strength, young warriors.

312
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,470
我们不需要你们这些外来移民
We don't need any of you immigrants.

313
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,680
（雷吉斯国王强迫“王者之剑” 进入加哈拉废墟？）

314
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,720
不论你有何种能力 都是来自于国王
Whatever strength you have is on loan from the king.

315
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,230
-没有他，你一无是处 -尼克斯，救救母亲
-You are nothing without him. -Nyx, help Mother.

316
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,520
瑟琳娜 趴下
Selena, get down.

317
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,760
尼夫海姆的外交官们一波波涌进城市
--and the waves of imperial diplomats entering the city.

318
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,110
她是公主？ 你确定吗？
The princess? Are you certain?

319
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,980
是的 陛下
Yes, Your Majesty.

320
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,440
她跟随最后一些帝国来者们 进入了城市
She was amongst the last of the imperial contingent to enter the city.

321
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,730
上车
Get in.

322
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,180
我现在要去报告情况了 长官
I'm reporting to my post now though, sir.

323
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,050
新任务
New orders.

324
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,280
快 我们要去接一位公主
Come on. We've got a princess to pick up.

325
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,030
车不错 长官
Nice ride, sir.

326
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,410
这是王子的车
It belongs to the prince.

327
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,570
我们接他出了城
We've taken him outside the city.

328
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,990
他不是要准备婚礼吗 长官？
Doesn't he have a wedding to plan, sir?

329
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,870
别再叫我“长官”了
Cut the "sir" crap.

330
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,080
国王有自己的打算
The king has a plan of his own.

331
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,710
诺克提斯王子和露娜弗雷亚公主 要在城外很远处见面
Prince Noctis and Princess Lunafreya are to meet far from Insomnia.

332
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,390
那她来这儿干什么？
What's she doing here then?

333
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,850
使局面更复杂
Complicating things.

334
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,180
我们派克劳去找公主 并且把她护送出戴涅布莱国
We sent Crowe to find the princess and escort her out of Tenebrae.

335
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,390
我们还在追查问题出在哪儿
We're still trying to figure out what went wrong.

336
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,160
我知道你对战争的看法 那你怎么看这场和平呢？
So I know what you think about this war, but what do you think about this peace?

337
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,750
放弃自己的家乡 你高兴吗？
You happy giving up your home?

338
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,760
这是国王的决定 因为他重用了我，我欠他的
It's the king's decision. I owe him for taking me in.

339
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,140
我很幸运 加哈拉有很多人没有这么幸运
I was lucky. There are people in Galahd who weren't.

340
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,380
他们需要我
And they need me.

341
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,760
你要回去吗？
So you're going back?

342
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,550
没有国王的魔法 你能怎么帮他们？
What good will you be without the king's magic?

343
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,730
是的 总是想要拯救别人
Yeah, always wanting to save somebody.

344
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,490
我明白了，听我说 你这样不能赢得战争
I get it. Believe me. But it doesn't win wars.

345
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,030
这不只是愿望
It's not just wanting.

346
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,410
这不只是关于我
It's not just me.

347
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,790
利波特斯才是你需要担心的人
Libertus is the one you need to worry about.

348
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,540
如果局势变糟 他肯定会回去
He'll go back if things gets worse.

349
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,660
糟糕的还在后面呢
The worst is yet to come.

350
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,350
{\an8}（西门，四公里 15号出口）

351
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,810
你知道你要阻止的人是谁吗？
Do you have any idea who you're stopping?

352
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,490
把门打开 或许明天你还能保住工作
Open this gate now, and maybe you'll have a job tomorrow.

353
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,620
-这是国王的命令 -你确定你想要挑起…
-King's orders. -Are you sure you want to risk...

354
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,540
外交争端吗？
...a diplomatic issue now, of all times?

355
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,960
我是露娜弗雷亚·诺克斯·芙尔累 公主的私人护卫…
I am the personal escort of Lady Lunafreya Nox Fleuret...

356
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,580
戴涅布莱国前任公主…
...princess of the former Tenebrae and--

357
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,630
我们国家广受爱戴的准新娘
And our kingdom's beloved bride-to-be.

358
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,710
欢迎来到主权管辖区 从现在开始，由我们一手接管
Welcome to sovereign jurisdiction. We'll take care of things from here.

359
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,340
-不还意思，德劳托斯长官 -送公主去往城堡
-Forgive me, Captain Drautos. -See Her Highness to the castle.

360
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,600
我完全不知道你… 我不清楚…
I had no idea that you-- I wasn't made aware of any--

361
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
-对不起，多谢 -不，你…我必须…
-Excuse me. Thank you. -No, you-- I must--

362
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,060
我必须… 我必须先跟我的上司解释清楚
I must-- No, I have to clear it with my superiors first.

363
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,760
公主殿下
Your Highness.

364
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,280
戴涅布莱国的公主殿下 露娜弗雷亚
Her Royal Highness, Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae.

365
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,750
好久不见了 陛下
It has been a long time, Your Majesty.

366
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,450
是呀
Yes.

367
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,130
太久了
Far too long.

368
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,590
诺克提斯王子不在这儿 是吗？
Prince Noctis isn't here, is he?

369
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,020
是的，亲爱的公主 他不在这儿
No, my dear. He is not.

370
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,230
我太老了 不能应战
I am too old to fight this war.

371
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:57,060
我别无选择 只能接受帝国的要求
I have no choice but to receive the empire and accept their treaty.

372
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,020
即便如此…
Even so...

373
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:04,200
我还是希望婚礼可以在别的地方举行 安全的地方
...I had hoped to hold the wedding elsewhere, somewhere safe.

374
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,280
我派出一名剑队成员去找你 但是…
I sent one of my Glaive to see you there, but--

375
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,950
现在还不晚
It is not too late.

376
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,210
我可以安派人护送你
I can ready an escort.

377
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,750
求你了 去找我的儿子
Please, go to my son.

378
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,470
不
No.

379
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,050
不管我去哪儿 帝国都会跟着我
Wherever I go, the empire will follow.

380
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,550
这样只会将王子置于更危险的境地
It would only place the prince in greater danger.

381
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:35,220
我的职责是保护王子 帮助他完成他的使命
It is my duty to protect the prince and see his destiny fulfilled.

382
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,060
十二年的时间没有改变我的初衷
These 12 years have not changed that.

383
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,190
那你的命运吗？
And what of your destiny?

384
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,190
我的职责就是我的命运 陛下
My duty is my destiny, Your Majesty.

385
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,610
我已经准备好迎接一切了
I'm prepared to accept whatever may come to pass.

386
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,470
你觉得怎么样？
So, what do you think?

387
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,920
这些领土很快都会变成帝国的了
All these lands will be imperial soon.

388
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,300
估计那些尼夫海姆人开始发号施令时 局面会变好吗？
Reckon things will get better when them Niffs start calling the shots?

389
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,130
没有一点儿好东西
Not one damn bit.

390
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,400
我才不管是谁掌权呢
Don't matter who's calling the shots.

391
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,480
只要他们是从那面墙后面来的…
Long as they're calling them from behind the Wall...

392
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,270
这里的情形就不会有好转
...ain't nothing gonna change around here.

393
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,490
过来这儿
Get over here.

394
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,200
好吧
All right.

395
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,620
这是一只手！
That's a hand!

396
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,740
我打赌这是一场欢乐的团聚？
I trust the reunion was a happy one?

397
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,450
这些年来 她一直都是尼夫海姆的人质吗？
Has she been a hostage of Niflheim all this time?

398
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,760
她是和平的象征 我就知道这些
She is a symbol of the peace. That's all I'm told.

399
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
听起来不像
Doesn't sound like it.

400
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,050
听起来她的到访 目的远非如此
Sounds like she's here for something much bigger than that.

401
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,330
你的任务是保护她
Your orders are to protect her.

402
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,670
不要观察她，不要倾听她 更不要去思考
Not to look, not to listen, not to think.

403
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,510
明白吗？
Understood?

404
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,770
我是德劳托斯
Drautos.

405
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,890
是的 汇报
Yes, report.

406
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,640
给我让开路 里面是我的朋友，该死
Get the hell out of my way. That's my friend you got in there, damn it.

407
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,780
先生，在检查结束之前 你不能进去
Sir, you can't go in until the examination has ended.

408
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,940
什么检查？ 到底是怎么回事？
What examination? What the hell's going on?

409
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,730
嘿，放松点儿 伙计
Hey, take it easy, big guy.

410
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,920
克劳一回来 这些混蛋就把她推进了这里
These bastards rushed Crowe in there the moment she got back.

411
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,000
现在他们不让我进去看她
And now they won't let me in to see her.

412
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,710
等一下
Wait.

413
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,830
克劳的私人物品
Crowe's personal effects.

414
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,160
你看着处理吧
Do with them as you see fit.

415
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,800
你到底派她去执行什么任务？
So, what kind of mission did you really send her on?

416
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,730
没有一个剑队成员 会在执行普通的护送任务时送命
No Glaive winds up dead on a standard escort.

417
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,720
停战不会影响进行详尽的调查
I'll see the armistice does not interfere with a full investigation.

418
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,490
她是一名优秀的战士
She was a good soldier.

419
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,400
她不会白白送死的
Her death will not go unanswered.

420
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,900
造化弄人呀 对吗？
What a life, huh?

421
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,000
她是个孤儿
She was brought up an orphan.

422
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,700
从她的村庄跑出来
Run out of her village.

423
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,840
我还记得第一次见到她
I still remember the first time I saw her.

424
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,100
骨瘦如柴的小家伙…
Scrawny little thing...

425
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,390
浑身脏兮兮的
...all covered in dirt.

426
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,100
全世界没有一个朋友
Not a friend in the world.

427
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,350
但是那双眼睛…
But those eyes....

428
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,190
该死
Damn.

429
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,400
那双眼睛里有故事
There was something about those eyes.

430
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,440
她不应该就这样死去
She deserved better.

431
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,920
我愿意为此付出一切…
And I would've done anything to give it to--

432
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,640
利波特斯 等一下
Libertus, wait.

433
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,010
克劳死的时候是一名剑队成员
Crowe died a Glaive.

434
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,820
你可以好好战斗 来纪念她
You can still honor her by fighting as one.

435
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,570
你有时候比我还蠢 你知道吗？
You're dumber than me sometimes, you know that?

436
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,650
你还不明白吗？
Don't you get it?

437
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,400
路西斯害死了克劳
Lucis killed Crowe.

438
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,700
回到城堡
Go back to the castle.

439
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:09,160
告诉国王 把弱者扔给饿狼是得不到和平的
Tell the king there's no peace to be had from throwing the weak to the wolves.

440
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,970
从现在开始 我要孤身作战
I'll fight my own fight from here on out.

441
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,310
再见了 英雄
See you around, hero.

442
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,540
一个发卡？
A hairpin?

443
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,590
我觉得你不会喜欢这种东西的
I didn't think you were into that kind of thing.

444
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,040
这不是给我的 是给公主的礼物
It's not for me. It's a gift for the princess.

445
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,060
{\an8}（签字仪式之夜）

446
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,470
真是一场盛大的欢迎仪式 雷吉斯国王
A most grand reception, King Regis.

447
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,130
您荣耀了所有的尼夫海姆人
You honor all of Niflheim.

448
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,220
荣耀是属于我们的 艾尔德卡普特国王
Oh, the honor is ours, Emperor Aldercapt.

449
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,770
您远道而来 大驾光临
You have ventured far to grace us with your presence.

450
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,020
尽微薄之力而已
It was the very least I could do.

451
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,890
对于我们两国而言 明天将会是历史性的一天
Tomorrow will be an historic day for both our nations.

452
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,360
您的因索莫尼亚真是一个奇迹
And your Insomnia is truly a marvel.

453
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,690
相比之下 我本国的城市黯然无光
My own cities pale in comparison.

454
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,880
我祈祷这次拜访能够满载而归
I pray we are able to take away much from this visit.

455
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,420
你好
Hello.

456
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,250
我想今天我们没有正式认识一下
I am afraid we were never properly introduced yesterday.

457
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,510
恐怕您还要等一下，公主殿下 我正在执勤
I'm afraid it's going to have to wait, Your Highness. I'm on guard duty.

458
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,390
那就更没有比这里更安全的地方了
Then surely there's no safer place for me to be.

459
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,640
我能知道你的名字吗？
May I ask your name?

460
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,320
尼克斯 尼克斯·乌尔里克
Nyx. Nyx Ulric.

461
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:44,200
我还有一件事要问你 尼克斯·乌尔里克
There is something else I wish to ask you, Nyx Ulric.

462
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,870
雷吉斯国王说 他派出了你们的一名队员去找我
King Regis said he sent one of your order to come find me.

463
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,500
我想要亲自谢谢他
I should like to offer my thanks in person.

464
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,500
我到哪儿才能找到这名英勇的士兵？
Where might I find this brave soldier?

465
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,890
我不是…
Oh, I did not--

466
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,300
-我很抱歉 -不必
-I am so sorry. -Don't be.

467
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,770
给你
Here.

468
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,240
她拿着这个
She was carrying this.

469
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,320
原本是要给你的
It was meant for you.

470
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,870
给我？
For me?

471
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,990
拿着吧
Keep it.

472
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,780
她肯定希望你能戴上它
She would've wanted you to have it.

473
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,380
我会一直随身带着的
I will carry it with me always.

474
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,200
谢谢你
Thank you.

475
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,790
你知道这种和平意味着什么吗？
Do you have any idea what this peace means?

476
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,400
它意味着我们的家乡没了…
It means our homes are gone...

477
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,960
所有的…
...all of them...

478
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,830
永远消失了
...forever.

479
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,470
我听说这儿有一些仇视和平协议的人
Heard I could find some treaty haters here.

480
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,120
我来对地方了吗？
I come to the right place?

481
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,010
当然了
You certainly have.

482
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,460
大家跟这个人打个招呼吧 他的职责是…
Everyone say hello to a man who spends his days...

483
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,710
在皇室里为伟大的国王效力
...in the loyal service of our good king.

484
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,730
“曾经”
"Spent."

485
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,310
那些日子一去不复返了
Those days are over.

486
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,520
我已经受够了那个混蛋的谎言
I'm done listening to that bastard's lies.

487
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,360
他或许高居王座 但是他不是国王…
He may sit on a throne, but he ain't no king...

488
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,600
至少不是我的国王
...least not of mine.

489
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,740
好吧 如此说来…
Well, then...

490
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,020
欢迎来到反政府组织 兄弟
...welcome to the resistance, brother.

491
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,690
我希望你有话要说
I hope you're here to talk.

492
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,620
你想知道什么？
What do you wanna know?

493
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,930
求您…
Please...

494
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,590
无论诺克提斯身在何处 保佑他的安全
...wherever Noctis is, keep him safe.

495
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,720
我别无他求
That is all I ask.

496
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,050
你向哪个神祈祷？
To what god do you pray?

497
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,930
你 命运的囚徒
You, the slave of fate and destiny.

498
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,720
放弃你的祈祷吧
Abandon your prayers.

499
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,650
神不会听的
The gods do not listen.

500
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,770
格拉乌卡将军 你为什么会在这儿？
General Glauca. Why are you here?

501
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,900
你这么聪明 肯定不会相信这次和平谈判
You are far too clever to have ever believed in this peace.

502
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:31,160
真可惜你见不到你挚爱的诺克提斯 你还有别的使命
Pity you couldn't see your beloved Noctis. You have another purpose.

503
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,030
-我来这儿不是为了尼夫海姆 -不是
-I'm not here for Niflheim. -No.

504
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,530
你来这儿是为了我
You are here for me.

505
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:36,880
你？
You?

506
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,460
我不明白
I do not understand.

507
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,290
明天你就会明白的
Come tomorrow, you will.

508
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,770
{\an8}（签字仪式当天）

509
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,560
尼夫海姆一行已经离开酒店
Niflheim contingent has left the hotel.

510
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,890
还有不到三个小时 仪式就要开始了
Less than three hours until the ceremony.

511
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,730
加强城堡守卫
Bolster the Citadel guard.

512
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,740
尼克斯 公主和你在一起吗？
Nyx, is the princess with you?

513
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,940
没有
No.

514
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,530
我在守卫城堡
I'm on duty at the Citadel.

515
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,110
那些尼夫海姆人已经出发前往仪式
Well, the Niffs just left for the ceremony.

516
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,330
她没有和他们在一起
And she wasn't with them.

517
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,770
-归航信标？ -是的，现在发送坐标
-A homing beacon? -Yeah, I'll send the coordinates now.

518
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,390
你能为我定位吗？
Can you pinpoint a location for me?

519
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,810
可以 但是听起来像是追着野鹅到处乱跑
Sure, but it sounds like a wild-goose chase.

520
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,730
我猜你有大把的时间 是吗？
Guess you got some free time on your hands, huh?

521
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,810
是的 不管怎样吧
Guess I do, for better or worse.

522
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,710
这些坐标都是在因索莫尼亚以南 二十英里的地方
Those coordinates are about 20 miles south of Insomnia.

523
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,640
城墙之外
Outside the Wall.

524
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,550
克劳去这些地方干什么？
What the hell was Crowe doing all the way out there?

525
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,760
不，不… 他们派她去…
No, no. They sent her to--

526
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,300
我需要你再帮我一个忙 皮尔纳
I need another favor, Pelna.

527
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,400
在雷达上把这些坐标都调出来 告诉我你发现了什么
Pull those coordinates up on the radar and let me know what you find.

528
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,310
收到 你觉得这事关重大吗？
On it. You're thinking this is all a big deal now, huh?

529
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,640
是的 不容忽视
Yeah, too big to ignore.

530
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,910
-对不起，先生 -嘿，嘿，嘿
-Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. -Hey, hey, hey.

531
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,980
-等一下 -停下
-Whoa, wait a minute. -Stop right there.

532
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,670
听好了 这里不仅仅是城门守卫
Listen up. This is not the gate watch.

533
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:28,790
这里是城市的核心 我们国王的家
This is the heart of our city, the home of our king.

534
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,630
仪式不容中断
The ceremony must not be disturbed.

535
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,140
要迅速地、悄悄地摆平一切威胁
Neutralize any threat quickly and quietly.

536
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,970
明白吗？
Is that understood?

537
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,920
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

538
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,550
剑队成员呼叫 你在吗，长官？
Glaive to command. Are you there, captain?

539
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:28,190
紧急呼叫
Urgent.

540
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,980
该死的 德劳托斯
Damn it, Drautos.

541
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,100
重大发现，尼克斯 在这个位置有一整队飞艇
Jackpot, Nyx. There's a whole fleet of airships sitting at that spot.

542
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,280
-尼夫海姆 -是的，看起来…
-Niflheim. -Yup, and from the looks of it...

543
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,990
我觉得他们在准备作战
...I'd say they're headed to war.

544
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,540
-队长在哪儿？ -应该在城堡
-Where's the captain? -Should be at the Citadel.

545
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,000
他的呼叫器没有应答
There's no answer on his frequency.

546
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,370
我不知道 现在肯定忙着护送任务
I don't know, must have his hands full with the escort detail.

547
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:48,130
皮尔纳，最后帮个忙 我需要你启动王者之剑
Pelna, one last favor. I need you to prep the Glaive for action.

548
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,460
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

549
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,330
你想要不经队长许可 擅自行动？
You wanna deploy without the captain's order?

550
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,830
相信我 动手吧
Trust me. Just get it done.

551
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,710
等一下 我该怎么跟他们说…？
Wait, what am I supposed to tell--?

552
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,960
后退 剑队队员
Stand down, Glaive.

553
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,850
仪式还有两个小时就要开始
The ceremony is in less than two hours.

554
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,880
我们必须做好准备
We must make ready.

555
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,100
很好
Very well.

556
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,560
陛下
Your Majesty.

557
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,600
一位王者之剑队员在此
A man of the Kingsglaive is here, sire.

558
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:15,140
要求见您
He demands an audience.

559
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,820
“要求”？
"Demands"?

560
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,490
-陛下，求您 -等一下
-Your Majesty, please. -Halt.

561
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,610
请下令启动王者之剑
Give the order to deploy the Glaive.

562
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,860
是你
You.

563
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,830
城墙以南二十英里 尼夫海姆军队已经做好了进攻的准备
A Niflheim fleet makes ready for war 20 miles to the south.

564
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,750
帝国的部队
An imperial fleet.

565
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,340
他们挟持了公主
And they have the princess.

566
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,330
克拉鲁斯 在签约室外增派守卫
Clarus, post guards outside the treaty room.

567
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,380
这样做将被视为对和平缺乏信心
It will be seen as a lack of faith in the peace.

568
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,180
我们应该避免如此
Which we all harbor.

569
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,380
照做吧
See it done.

570
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,130
我们也许还要 把艾尔德卡普特皇帝置于监禁之下
We may well have to take Emperor Aldercapt into custody.

571
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,010
监禁他？
Detain him?

572
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,470
这绝对等同于再次宣战
That would go beyond a new declaration of war.

573
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,060
我们仍处在战争状态，克拉鲁斯
We are still at war, Clarus.

574
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,480
还有你，尼克斯·乌尔里克
And you, Nyx Ulric.

575
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,980
王者之剑多快能够部署？
How soon can the Kingsglaive deploy?

576
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,610
谨候命令，随时都可以
On your word, at once.

577
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,790
那就去吧
Go, then.

578
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,500
救出露娜
Save Luna.

579
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,460
如果这是调虎离山呢？
What if this is a diversion?

580
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,920
不太可能
Not likely.

581
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,290
戴涅布莱的公主在飞艇上
Tenebrae's princess is onboard.

582
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,340
我们有两件任务
We've got two jobs.

583
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,730
救公主
Save her.

584
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:30,350
阻止尼夫海姆的飞艇 飞临因索莫尼亚
And stop those Niff ships from flying on Insomnia.

585
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,110
我们分组行动
We go in teams.

586
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,780
标准的渗透和拔除行动
Standard infiltrate and extract.

587
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,650
尼克斯，你来指挥，我们听命
Nyx, you command. We'll follow.

588
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,290
王者之剑并肩作战 无论有没有指挥官
The Glaive stands together, captain or no.

589
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,540
为了温暖
For hearth.

590
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,210
还有家园
And home!

591
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:12,550
距离这项历史性的停战协议的签署 还有不到二十分钟
We are less than 20 minutes away from the signing of this historic treaty.

592
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,190
我接到国王的命令展开部署
I received word of the king's order to deploy.

593
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,860
我来对付城里的事情
I'll see to matters in the city.

594
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,950
你有你的任务 而且并不轻松
You have your mission, and it won't be easy.

595
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,540
目标有两个
The objective is two-fold.

596
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,950
营救人质 阻止敌人的前进
Secure the hostage, and stay the enemy advance.

597
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,240
要小心
Just be careful.

598
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,750
一位剑队成员已经因公主而牺牲
One Glaive already died for this princess.

599
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,510
尼夫海姆不会轻易把她交出来的
Niflheim won't give her up easily.

600
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,940
第二组
Team Two.

601
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,450
我的天
Oh, man.

602
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,280
快点，尼克斯！
Hurry up, Nyx!

603
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,920
救命！
Help!

604
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,600
这边来
Over here.

605
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,860
准备进入甲板下
Preparing to head below deck.

606
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,700
没有命令，不要和敌人正面接触
Do not engage the enemy until instructed.

607
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,270
庆祝仪式仍在进行
The ceremony is underway.

608
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,200
我们等着看尼夫海姆要如何玩
Let's wait and see how Niflheim plays this.

609
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,380
王者之剑已经渗透进敌舰
The Kingsglaive have infiltrated the ships.

610
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,910
一切按计划进行
So everything's going according to plan.

611
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:35,240
乌尔里克报告 六艘尼夫海姆飞艇正飞往因索莫尼亚
Ulric reporting. Six Niflheim airships confirmed inbound for Insomnia.

612
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,950
尼克斯，这不像是一支作战舰队
Nyx, this doesn't feel like a war fleet.

613
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,940
我应该是找到她了 这里有一扇有守卫的门
I think I might've found her. I got a guarded door here.

614
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:14,110
两个尼夫海姆的甲兵看守 我该怎么办？
Two Niff MTs. What's the plan?

615
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,610
原地待命
Hold position.

616
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,630
到达指定地点 目标很有可能就在附近
Arrived at destination. High possibility of target in the vicinity.

617
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,500
解救人质
Proceed to secure.

618
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,080
那就必须动手
It's going to mean a fight.

619
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,890
小点声 不要闹大
Keep it quiet and keep it confined.

620
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,140
佩尔纳，你可以接敌了 但是要小点声
Pelna, you're clear to engage. But keep it quiet.

621
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,130
我这就去
I'm on my way.

622
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,270
请原谅我来迟了
Forgive my delay.

623
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,740
有一些意料之外的麻烦
A bit of unforeseen trouble.

624
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,740
希望不是什么大麻烦
Nothing too vexing, I hope.

625
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,700
只是一个小贼而已
A simple theft, nothing more.

626
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,150
贼胆包天 居然偷到国王头上
A daring thief, to steal from the king.

627
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:01,670
也许魔法城墙和城堡大门 也不能保证一切安全
Perhaps magical walls and castle gates do not keep all things safe.

628
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,380
也许吧
Perhaps.

629
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:07,660
不过不要紧 偷走的很快都要被归还
But no matter. That which was taken will soon be returned.

630
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,680
难以置信
Impressive.

631
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,040
你是王者中沉着的典范
You are a paragon of kingly composure.

632
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,720
但是我必须发问
But I must ask...

633
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:20,590
你何以如此确定呢？
...how can you be so sure?

634
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:24,060
因为这件东西并不仅仅是装饰品
Because this thing is no mere trinket.

635
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,070
它有自己的意志
It possesses a will all its own.

636
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,450
足以打破任何盗贼的束缚
Enough to break any thief's grasp.

637
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,490
听起来确实是一件不错的奖品
That sounds a very fine prize indeed.

638
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,750
该死的，不是现在
Not now, damn it.

639
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,470
给我的？ 你太客气了
For me? You shouldn't have.

640
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,720
目标确认 她一切安好
Target confirmed. She's unharmed.

641
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:07,350
陛下，剑队找到了公主
The Glaives have recovered the princess, Your Majesty.

642
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,310
你找到那个贼了吗？
Have you found your thief?

643
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,910
找到了
We have.

644
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,660
被偷走的东西完好无损
And what was stolen remains intact.

645
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,230
大好的消息
Joyous news.

646
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,870
这下我就放心了
I am relieved to hear it.

647
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,380
告诉我
Tell me...

648
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,990
在你的帝国里
...how heavy a sentence...

649
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,160
偷窃将要面对怎样的刑罚？
...does the crime of theft carry in your empire?

650
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,710
最重的刑罚之一
Among the heaviest.

651
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,220
不过…
Although there is one...

652
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,090
有一个例外
...exception.

653
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,420
这里将要乱成一片了
Things are about to get ugly over here.

654
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,630
佩尔纳，快离开 这是个圈套
Pelna, get out of there. It's a trap.

655
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:45,840
-是什么？ -一条有趣的古老法律
-What is that? -A curious old law...

656
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,650
在边疆地区仍然有效
...I still permit in the outlands.

657
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,680
如果盗贼能逃脱追捕
A thief who escapes his captor...

658
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,450
他就不必再为自己的罪行负责
...can no longer be held to account for his crime.

659
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,030
这是对受害者的警告
A warning to the victim.

660
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,540
不要示弱 以免放松正义之手
Never show weakness, lest you forgo the hand of justice.

661
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,990
不，尊敬的国王
Oh, no, good king.

662
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,090
并非如此
Far from it.

663
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,330
协议已经被呈在桌上
The treaty is now on the table.

664
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,090
这个历史性时刻进入倒计时
The countdown begins to this historical moment.

665
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,380
这是对正义之手的警告
It is a warning to the hand of justice itself...

666
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:21,270
永远不要松开握紧的拳头
...never to loose its grip.

667
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,820
第一组，保护外围
Unit One, secure the perimeter.

668
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,810
第二组，原地守卫
Unit Two, stand your ground.

669
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,190
佩尔纳
Pelna.

670
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,700
戴涅布莱公主安全…
One Tenebrae princess, safe and--

671
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:48,450
快走
Come on.

672
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,200
水晶 他们是冲着水晶来的
The crystal. They're after the crystal.

673
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,690
甲板下面出事了
There's something going on below deck.

674
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,660
这艘飞艇飞不到因索莫…
The ship's not going to make it to Insom--

675
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:34,800
你…
You....

676
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,470
出了什么事？
What's going on?

677
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:39,840
因索莫尼亚正在遭受攻击
Insomnia is under attack.

678
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,600
是谁把你带来的？
Who brought you here?

679
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,140
-格拉乌卡将军 -你是诱饵
-General Glauca. -You were bait.

680
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,510
我们到这里来 也是他们的计划的一部分
Us coming here was all part of their plan.

681
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,090
目标被营救 请求准许撤退
Target secured. Request permission to withdraw.

682
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,840
准许 去…
Granted. Get to--

683
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,660
水晶是不会为你效劳的
The crystal will not serve you.

684
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,830
也不会为你
Nor you...

685
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,090
我要把它带离这座被诅咒的城市
...once I take it from this accursed city.

686
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,540
我来不是为了水晶
It's not the crystal I'm here for.

687
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,050
城墙没有了
The Wall. It's gone.

688
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,420
撤退 这是个圈套
Fall back. It's a trap.

689
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,650
到底是怎么回事？
What the hell is going on?

690
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,040
叛徒
Traitors.

691
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,830
你怎么了？
What's got into you?

692
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,450
来吧，趁着还有机会快撤
Come, we must escape while we can.

693
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,290
不，克拉鲁斯
No, Clarus.

694
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,920
恐怕逃跑这条路已经走不通了
I fear escape is no longer an option.

695
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,930
格拉乌卡将军
General Glauca.

696
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:42,020
你能坚持住吗？
Can you make it up? Can you stand?

697
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,960
卢彻！
Luche!

698
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,890
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

699
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,010
开什么玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

700
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,270
皇家学院教授驾驶吗？
They teach piloting back at the royal academy?

701
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,190
交给我吧
Give me that.

702
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:41,700
老朋友 我已经很久没有与你并肩战斗了
Been a long time since I fought at your side, old friend.

703
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:43,250
是的
Yes...

704
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:46,240
但这次的战斗不是你的
...but this time it is not your fight.

705
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:48,120
如果你想离开 现在就走吧
If you wish to leave, go now.

706
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,540
抛下我的国王？ 绝不
And abandon my king? I think not.

707
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:55,170
另外，我们的魔法都系与你一身
Besides, our magic is bound to you.

708
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,060
如果你倒下，路西斯就完了
If you fall, Lucis falls.

709
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:01,180
那就让我们再次战斗吧
Then let us once more into the fray...

710
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:02,940
老朋友
...old friend.

711
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:31,840
你必须带我去见雷吉斯王
You must take me back to King Regis.

712
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,710
你疯了吗？ 因索莫尼亚是战场
Are you out of your mind? Insomnia's a war zone.

713
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:37,710
我有一个责任 不能忘记
I have a duty. I cannot neglect it.

714
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,170
-是啊，这种话我早就听过了 -那你应该知道，我们必须抓紧
-Yeah, I heard all that before. -Then you know we must hurry.

715
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,220
抓紧做什么？ 找死吗？
Hurry to do what? Get yourself killed?

716
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:44,390
我不害怕死亡
I do not fear death.

717
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,440
无畏公主的举动就免了吧
Enough with all this brave princess act.

718
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:53,930
还是祈祷这东西能飞到目的地吧
Just pray this thing will make the trip.

719
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:20,010
克拉鲁斯
Clarus.

720
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,050
我想一切都在照计划进行
Well, I daresay everything has proceeded according to plan.

721
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,550
-不是吗？ -确实如此
-No? -So it has.

722
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,400
我们已经破坏了城墙
We have broken the Wall.

723
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,100
现在只剩下摧毁这座城市了
All that remains is to break the city.

724
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,370
我们应该走了吧？
Shall we take our leave, then?

725
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:41,580
马上就要日落了
The sun will soon set.

726
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:46,250
我们不必在这里目击黑夜的恐怖
We need not be here to witness the terrors of the night.

727
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,510
神圣水晶
The crystal.

728
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:06,100
你飞得太快了 我们必须降落
You're going too fast. We have to land.

729
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:10,220
-你得再容我一会儿 -没有时间了，我自己去
-You're gonna have to give me a minute. -There is no time. I will go on my own.

730
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:13,470
你的衣服下面藏着翅膀吗？ 魔法是没用的
You got wings underneath that dress? You can't use magic.

731
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,680
不是一切奇迹都要靠魔法
Not all miracles are made by magic.

732
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,570
我不害怕死亡
I do not fear death.

733
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:21,650
我所怕的是 什么也不做，因而失去一切
What I fear is doing nothing and losing everything.

734
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,040
没办法
Oh, come on.

735
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,660
殿下，这个奇迹靠的还是魔法
You can thank magic for that miracle, Your Highness.

736
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,480
到了清算的时候了
The reckoning is at hand.

737
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,620
新时代的曙光就在眼前
Dawn of a new age.

738
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:11,070
你已经拿到了水晶 你还想从我这拿走什么？
You have the crystal. What more would you take from me?

739
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,810
路西斯之戒
The Ring of the Lucii.

740
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:31,300
我失去了我的母亲、我的国家 我与生俱来的权力
I lost my mother, my country, my birth-right.

741
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:33,890
尼夫海姆是我唯一的希望
Niflheim was the only life left to me.

742
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,730
但这一切都是为了它
But all of that was for this.

743
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,440
这枚戒指现在属于我了
The ring belongs to me now.

744
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:54,790
侧耳听吧，古时的路西斯众王 我是雷夫斯·诺克斯·弗洛雷
Hear me, Lucian kings of old, for I am Ravus Nox Fleuret...

745
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,340
世间唯我配得拥有你们的能力
...and none is more worthy of your power than I.

746
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:02,470
不…为什么？
No. Why?

747
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:04,640
你们为什么拒绝我？
Why do you refuse me?

748
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,160
当心
Look out.

749
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:54,390
快，从这出去
Quickly, through here.

750
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:16,710
这里通往一条秘密通道
This leads to a hidden passageway.

751
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,920
沿着通道走
Follow it.

752
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,790
离开之后 前往艾尔提夏
Once you are away, make for Altissia.

753
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,210
诺克提斯在那里等着你们
Noctis awaits you there.

754
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,290
-陛下 -你早知道这些事将要发生…
-Your Majesty. -You knew this was coming--

755
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,460
是的，但只有这样 才能让他们的怒气转离诺克提斯
Yes. But it was the only way to draw their wrath from Noctis.

756
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:31,340
这就是我们的王吗？
Is that the way of our king?

757
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:34,730
牺牲路西斯众子来救他自己的命？
Sacrifice Lucian sons to save his own?

758
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,560
是为了救这个世界
To save the world.

759
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,810
把露娜安全送到艾尔提夏
See Luna safely to Altissia.

760
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:45,480
这不是国王向剑队发出的命令
This is not an order from a king to his Glaive.

761
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:49,160
这是一个男人向另一个男人的恳求 拜托，尼克斯·乌尔里克，保她安全
This is a plea from one man to another. Please, Nyx Ulric, keep her safe.

762
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,990
为了所有人的未来
For the future of all.

763
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,940
未来？
The future?

764
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,570
给
Here.

765
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,170
拿着
Take this.

766
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:03,880
是时候把它交给别人保管了
It is time it passed to another's keeping.

767
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,400
不，求你住手
No, please. Stop.

768
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,490
-回来 -求你了，别离开我们
-Get back. -Please. Don't leave us.

769
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,500
我知道 你的母亲与我有同样的企盼
I know your mother would wish the same as me.

770
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,510
就是你和诺克提斯幸福地生活
That you and Noctis live happily.

771
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:52,670
你被囚禁这么多年 都因我的失败
All those years captive because I failed you.

772
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,880
但这次不会了
Not again.

773
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,930
紧锁的大门再也不能捆绑你的命运
Locked doors will seal your fate no longer.

774
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,010
雷吉斯国王
King Regis....

775
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,890
我们的希望系于你的身上 尼克斯·乌尔里克…祝你成功
Our hope goes with you now, Nyx Ulric. Godspeed.

776
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,840
看啊，路西斯的王
Behold the King of Lucis...

777
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:45,610
躲在宝贵的城墙后面 积累着平安
...who hoarded tranquility within his precious walls.

778
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,610
你的平安去哪了，陛下？
Where is your tranquility now, king?

779
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,690
你的平安来了 靠的是钢铁的猛然落下
Here is your peace, by steel's swift descent.

780
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:12,260
快走
Go.

781
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:35,650
不，我们必须快点离开这儿
No. We must get away from here.

782
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,620
这才是你的国王的意愿
It is what your king wanted.

783
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,230
露娜弗雷亚带着戒指逃跑了
Lady Lunafreya has escaped with the ring.

784
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,940
马上找到她
Find her at once.

785
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,580
她不能离开这座城市
She is not to leave the city.

786
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:29,700
-乌尔里克呼叫指挥官，队长，回话 -附近一架监控摄像头…
-Ulric to command. Come in, captain. -Footage of the perpetrators...

787
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:31,870
拍下了罪犯的影像
...was captured by a nearby surveillance camera.

788
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,000
以下是六名嫌犯的图像
Here are images of the six suspects.

789
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,050
其中一人被确认为加拉哈难民 利波特斯·奥斯提姆
One has been identified as Galahdian refugee, Libertus Ostium...

790
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:41,590
前路西斯王者之剑成员
...a former member of the Lucian Kingsglaive.

791
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,520
嘿，起来
Hey, come here. Come here.

792
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,690
我来救你 你没事了
I got you, I got you. You're all right.

793
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,520
你没事了
You're okay.

794
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:51,690
没事了
It's fine.

795
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,100
我们自由了
We're free.

796
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,060
我们现在自由了
We're free now.

797
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,190
我们自由了？ 你这是什么意思？
We're free? What do you mean, "We're free"?

798
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,950
帝国…有承诺
The empire. They promised.

799
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:02,730
这个地区是我们的
This district's ours.

800
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,660
是我们这些难民的
All the refugees.

801
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,650
这是我们的新家园
It's our new home.

802
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:10,420
-帝国？你投靠了尼夫海姆？ -给你
-The empire? You went in with Niflheim? -Here.

803
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:13,700
拿着它 与其他人会合
Take this. Meet up with the others.

804
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:18,800
你是我们的革命英雄，兄弟
You're the hero of our revolution, brother.

805
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:24,970
该死
Damn it.

806
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,280
这家伙还不知道他被击中了
This guy just doesn't know when he's beat.

807
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,740
-你会开车吗？ -我可以试试
-Can you drive? -I can try.

808
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,690
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

809
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,250
这次飞不回去了，英雄
No warping for you this time, hero.

810
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,090
把方向盘给我 让开
Give me the wheel. Go.

811
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,170
你的魔法没了
You are without your magic.

812
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:13,020
你也注意到了？ 一定是因为国王死了
You noticed that, huh? It must have died with the king.

813
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:17,470
你把我的城市搞得一团糟，剑队队员 我告诫过你，不要逞英雄
You're making a mess of my city, Glaive. I thought I told you not to go playing hero.

814
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:19,320
把飞艇交给我吧
Leave the ship to me.

815
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:22,200
你还有皇家的事情要办
Looks like you got a royal fare to see to.

816
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,070
出去
Move it.

817
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,150
也许并非所有的奇迹都是出于魔法
Maybe not all miracles are made by magic.

818
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,780
太好了
Oh, great.

819
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,970
你做了什么 惹得这些家伙如此生气？
The hell did you do to piss these things off?

820
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,890
它们追的不是我 而是戒指
It's not me they're after. It's the ring.

821
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:18,520
那枚戒指有什么特殊的？ 别告诉我未来就靠它了
What's so special about this ring? Don't tell me the future's riding on it.

822
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,470
戴上这枚戒指的人 可以与路西斯人沟通
He who wears the ring communes with the Lucii...

823
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,990
-并驾驭强大的力量 -什么样的力量？
-...and commands great power. -What kind of power?

824
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:26,030
禁忌的力量 很久以前被封在这枚戒指中
A forbidden one. Sealed within the ring, long ago.

825
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:31,110
旧城墙 我以为那只是睡前故事
The Old Wall. I thought that was just a bedtime story.

826
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,210
我可以担保 那不是睡前故事
I can assure you it is not.

827
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:43,500
但路西斯人只将这种力量 交与他们认为配得的人
But the Lucii grant their power only to those they deem worthy.

828
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:45,800
所以刚才那个戴上戒指的人…
So that guy who tried it on back there...

829
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,790
我猜他们认为他不配
...I guess he wasn't deemed worthy.

830
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:50,630
那是我哥哥
That was my brother.

831
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:55,640
这十二年改变了雷夫斯
These 12 years have changed Ravus.

832
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,730
他痴迷于过去 迷失在对权力的贪欲中
He is bound by the past, and lost in his lust for power.

833
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,260
它们是怎么找到我们的？
How the hell did they find us?

834
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,580
你的发卡被它们追踪 把它给我
Your hairpin. They're tracking it. Give it to me.

835
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:36,390
我曾有一个小妹妹 它在帝国入侵时被害
I had a little sister once. She was killed when the empire came.

836
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:40,010
我救不了她
I couldn't save her.

837
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:43,890
那时的我 就像现在一样无助
I was as helpless then as I am now.

838
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:49,110
我无法让她看到自己向往的未来
I couldn't show her the future she wanted.

839
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,290
真正的力量 是无法被那些寻求它的人发现的
True power is not something that is found by those who seek it.

840
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:58,910
它会找到配得上拥有它的人
It is something that comes to those who deserve it.

841
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,950
你的妹妹也希望你能看到未来
Your sister wanted you to see a future as well.

842
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,960
任何人对他们所爱的家人 都有同样的希望
Anyone would wish the same for family they love.

843
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,810
你是不会放过任何机会的，是吧？
You don't pull any punches, do you?

844
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:26,070
我在这
I'm over here.

845
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,570
听见了吗？ 我重复一遍…我是德劳托斯
Do you hear me? Repeat, this is Drautos.

846
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,060
能听得见吗？ 完毕
Can you hear me? Over.

847
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,410
你真会挑时候啊，队长
Your timing's impeccable, captain.

848
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:39,500
如果真有路西斯人
If the Lucii are real...

849
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:42,500
他们确实不在乎 自己的城市被撕碎
...they sure don't seem to mind their city getting torn apart.

850
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,620
你要重新归队 明白吗？
You're to rendezvous and regroup. Understood?

851
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:54,550
也许没那么容易，队长
Might not be so easy, captain.

852
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:58,140
也许你还不知道 我的翅膀被剪了
My wings have been clipped, if you didn't know.

853
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,160
乌尔里克，你还好吧？
Ulric. Are you all right?

854
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,800
我还没死 你是想问这个吗，长官？
I'm not dead, if that's what you mean, sir.

855
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,750
尽快前往D区
Head for Section D as soon as you can.

856
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:41,230
我让营救队准备好
I'll have an evacuation team ready.

857
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,220
看来我们不能在城门见面了
Don't suppose you could meet me at the gate.

858
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,720
我确实很想离开这座城市
I'd kind of like to get the hell out of this city.

859
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:49,560
帝国的军队控制了所有出口 没有能够冲出去的地方
Imperials hold all exits. There's no way through.

860
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:50,980
我们在D区见面
I'll meet you at Section D.

861
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:55,200
在此之前切断一切无线电联络 你要保证到达那里
Cut all radio contact until then. And make sure you get there.

862
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,410
这是一次亲密约会，长官
It's a date, sir.

863
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:15,550
没有回头路了
Ain't no turning back now.

864
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:17,000
状况报告
Status report.

865
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:19,170
乌尔里克杀死了一些人
Ulric killed some good men.

866
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:21,550
-戒指呢？ -还没拿到
-What about the ring? -We don't have it yet.

867
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:25,140
我是格拉乌卡 雷吉斯国王死了
This is Glauca. King Regis is dead.

868
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:27,900
戒指即将前往D区
The ring is on its way to Section D.

869
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,610
我们必须找到戒指 实现我们的目标
We must recover the ring to realize our goal.

870
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:33,610
如果乌尔里克或是公主出手阻止 那就干掉他们
If Ulric or the princess get in the way, take them out.

871
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:36,060
夺回我们的温暖与家园
Reclaim our hearth and home.

872
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:38,150
“温暖与家园”？
"Hearth and home"?

873
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,450
利波特斯，回话
Libertus, come in.

874
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:41,280
你在哪？你没事吧？
Where are you? Are you all right?

875
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:42,790
我很好
I'm fine.

876
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,540
我正在回基地的路上
On the way back to base now.

877
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,160
我们需要你前往D区的交叉路口
We need you to head to the junction in Section D.

878
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:51,550
我们将与另一组人会合 把那个地方打扫干净
We're gonna join with another unit, make a clean sweep of the place.

879
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:54,340
我们离革命胜利只差一步了
We're one step away from realizing this revolution.

880
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,710
不要让普鲁维亚白白死去
Let's not let Pruvia's death be in vain.

881
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,140
我们等着你，英雄
We'll be waiting for you, hero.

882
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:28,950
-在我说“安全”以前不要动 -明白
-Don't move until I say it's safe, all right? -I won't.

883
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,130
乌尔里克报告
Ulric, reporting.

884
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,460
我把公主带来了
I have the princess.

885
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,710
她活的好好的
She's alive and well.

886
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,930
-不！ -快离开
-No! -Get out of here.

887
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,660
你还真能打呀，尼克斯 这一点我承认
You've got some fight in you, Nyx, I'll give you that.

888
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,230
快跑
Run. Now.

889
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:09,240
我没想到 你身中一枚空尖弹头，居然还能动
I can't believe you're still moving with that hollowpoint in you.

890
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:13,080
空尖弹头撕裂克劳体内的时候 她只能惨叫
All Crowe could do was scream, when one tore her insides apart.

891
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:18,220
-你为什么要这么做？ -因为王者之剑什么也不是
-Why'd you do it? -Because the Kingsglaive is nothing.

892
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:19,970
作一个老家伙的炮灰
An old man's battle fodder...

893
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:21,890
为了因索莫尼亚的战争而死
...sent to die in Insomnia's war...

894
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:23,800
而我们的家园却在枷锁之中
...while our homes are bound and shackled.

895
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,670
尼夫海姆夺去了你的家园
Niflheim took your home.

896
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,800
夺去了我们所有人的家园
Took all our homes!

897
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:33,770
任何事都不能改变这一切
Nothing will ever change that.

898
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,980
你永远不够聪明
You never were too smart.

899
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:40,320
你本来可以在帝国拥有崭新的未来
You could've had a new future with the empire.

900
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,380
你无处可逃了，公主
There's nowhere to run, princess.

901
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,880
戒指
The ring.

902
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:05,640
把它给我
Give it to me.

903
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,830
如此多人 为了这样一件小东西而死
So many dead over so simple a thing.

904
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:35,160
为什么？为了什么？
But why? For what?

905
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,380
力量
Power.

906
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:40,200
无尽的力量 像你这种人是无法驾驭的
Untold power, beyond the control of someone like you.

907
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,710
力量
Power....

908
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:25,760
队长
Captain.

909
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,230
尼克斯
Nyx.

910
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:46,350
一切都结束了 恶魔已经被释放
It's over. The daemons are unleashed.

911
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,910
路西斯沦陷了
Lucis is fallen.

912
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:53,440
交出戒指
Surrender the ring.

913
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:00,120
想把自己的想法告诉那些国王吗？
Plan on giving those kings a piece of your mind, princess?

914
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:04,910
记得吗？你在这里还有未尽的使命
You got a destiny to take care of here, remember?

915
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,430
另外，有没有人告诉你
Besides, didn't anyone tell you?

916
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:12,850
我才是这里的英雄
I'm the hero around here.

917
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:35,040
现身吧，路西斯的众王
Show yourselves, kings of Lucis.

918
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:42,710
你呼求这个世界的未来，凡夫俗子
You call upon the wards of this world's future, mortal.

919
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:47,620
如果你贪恋我们的力量 就必须首先经受我们的审判
And if you come lusting for our power, you must first stand in our judgment.

920
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,630
你们要旁观因索莫尼亚焚烧到几时？
How long will you do nothing whilst Insomnia burns?

921
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:55,460
老的少的 无论你们是谁
Old or new, or whatever it is.

922
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:58,680
筑起你们的城墙
Summon your Wall.

923
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:00,940
你不能命令我们
You do not command us.

924
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:04,260
你根本就不是皇室血脉
Yours is not even royal blood.

925
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,530
保护你们的城市 根本不是我们的职责
It does not fall to us to guard your city.

926
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:09,140
人类是愚蠢的生物
Man is a fool creature...

927
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,370
紧紧抓住过去 对未来畏缩不前
...clinging to his past and cowering from his future.

928
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:16,120
为了已经逝去的日子而白费力气
Wasting his strength on bygone days.

929
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:19,280
你们又有什么未来？
And what future are you wards of?

930
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:20,780
太短视了
So shortsighted.

931
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,280
并且被咒诅 永远不能超越其上
And cursed never to rise above it.

932
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,630
等一下
Wait.

933
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:28,120
我见过这个勇敢的灵魂准备做什么
I have seen what this brave soul is prepared to do.

934
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:31,040
他也想保护未来
He, too, seeks to safeguard the future.

935
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:32,460
陛下
Your Majesty.

936
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:37,060
好吧，年轻的国王 我们将考量你的武士的价值
Very well, young king. We will weigh your warrior's worth.

937
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:39,760
但我们的恩惠并不廉价
But our boon does not come cheap.

938
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:46,150
代价是一条生命 他的、或是她的
The cost is a life. His or hers.

939
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:47,990
不
No.

940
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,690
去你的力量吧
To hell with your power.

941
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:55,030
我不是为此而来的
I'm not here for it.

942
01:27:56,450 --> 01:28:00,620
我只是来告诉你们 你们不是王
I only came to tell you, you are no kings.

943
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:04,170
你的价值已经被考量 结论是不够格
Your worth has been weighed and found wanting.

944
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:06,080
燃烧吧
Now burn.

945
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:15,050
你将失去那宝贵的戒指
You're going to lose your precious ring.

946
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,590
但拯救它还为时未晚
But it's not too late to save it.

947
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:23,470
你要用它交换生命吗？
You mean to barter for your life.

948
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,600
不
No, no.

949
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,770
我的生命不算什么
My life is nothing.

950
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:34,650
给那些希望看到未来的人一个未来
Giving a future to those who want to see it...

951
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,070
这才是最重要的
...is everything.

952
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:43,490
你并不害怕 即使那个未来已经注定灭亡
You do not fear, even if that future is doomed.

953
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:47,740
如果这份感情并非虚假 那么也许你还有些价值
If that sentiment is not false, perhaps you are worthy.

954
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,700
我们将授予你我们的光
We will grant you our light.

955
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,800
但是你要知道 太阳升起之后，它就将消失
But know it will set when the sun rises.

956
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:57,640
为此付出的代价将是你的生命
And the price for it will be your life.

957
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:02,850
你们可真会讨价还价
You guys drive a hard bargain.

958
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,440
我在哪签字？
Where do I sign?

959
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,610
等我慢慢习惯吧
I could get used to this.

960
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,200
尼克斯
Nyx....

961
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:29,170
-对不起 -不必
-I'm sorry. -Don't be.

962
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,000
你救了我
You saved me.

963
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:34,010
现在我欠你的
Now I owe you.

964
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:35,830
换换也好
For a change.

965
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,380
我需要你再帮一个忙
I'm gonna need another favor.

966
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:42,770
这位是露娜弗雷亚·诺克斯·弗洛雷 我们的王子未来的新娘
Meet Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, our prince's beloved bride-to-be.

967
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:45,850
她的手中掌握着这个世界的未来
And she has the future of the world in her hands.

968
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:49,400
保护她的安全 带她离开因索莫尼亚
Keep her safe, get her out of Insomnia.

969
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,430
差点忘了 你需要这个
Oh, I almost forgot. You'll need this.

970
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,310
代我向诺克提斯王子致意
Give Prince Noctis my regards.

971
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:00,120
从现在开始 利波特斯将照顾你
Libertus will take care of you from here.

972
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,440
一路平安，殿下
Have a safe journey, Your Highness.

973
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:06,860
-你怎么办？ -你要干什么？
-What will come of you? -What the hell are you doing?

974
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:09,410
遵循众王的命令
Following the kings' orders.

975
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:12,710
我会把戒指交给诺克提斯
I will see the ring to Noctis.

976
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,330
未来将会平安 我发誓
The future will be safe. I swear it.

977
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:29,430
你想靠拳头杀出城吗？ 留着吧
Planning on punching your way out of the city? Keep it.

978
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,930
-现在我们扯平了 -不
-Now we're even. -No.

979
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:34,680
等你回到加拉哈在算账
We'll settle up once you're back in Galahd.

980
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,400
我和其他所有人等着你
Me and everyone else will be waiting for you.

981
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:38,990
全靠你了
I'm counting on you...

982
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,370
英雄
...hero.

983
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:03,380
-系好安全带，公主 -我的命在你手中
-Buckle up, princess. -My life is in your hands.

984
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:16,570
路西斯人的力量又回来了
So, the power of the Lucii returns.

985
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:18,730
没关系 你没有时间了
No matter. You are out of time.

986
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,990
为了你，我可以挤一些时间
For you, I'll make some.

987
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:57,150
你有什么希望？
What can you hope to do?

988
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:01,570
一人对付整个帝国
One man against an empire.

989
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,520
对付众恶魔
Against the daemons.

990
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:07,790
没有城墙保护 你怎么拯救因索莫尼亚？
How will you save Insomnia with no wall to protect you?

991
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:13,380
你完全错了 我不是为了拯救因索莫尼亚而战
You've got it all wrong. I'm not fighting to save Insomnia.

992
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:44,470
这就是强大的旧城墙
So this is the might of the Old Wall.

993
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:48,340
不可思议 真的不可思议
Marvelous. Truly marvelous.

994
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:01,410
你为什么要这么做？
Why'd you do it?

995
01:35:01,710 --> 01:35:04,000
路西斯、尼夫海姆
Lucis. Niflheim.

996
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:06,840
重要的不是为谁而战 而是为了什么
It isn't who we fight for that matters, only what.

997
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:11,880
我们为了家园而战 这才是我们的忠诚所在
We fight for our homes. That is where our allegiance lies.

998
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:33,760
这种景象难得一见
That's not something you see every day.

999
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:53,310
多么可惜的浪费
Oh, such a pitiable waste.

1000
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:58,230
这些漂亮的街道 变成丑陋的废墟
All those beautiful city streets, all laid to unsightly ruin.

1001
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:01,830
-我要返回尼夫海姆 -这么快？
-I will return to Niflheim. -So soon?

1002
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:04,170
神圣水晶已经是我们的了
The crystal is ours.

1003
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,250
把这里的事弄完
Finish this...

1004
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:09,040
让恶魔们随意处置吧
...and see the daemons disposed of.

1005
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:10,590
谨遵圣命
As you command.

1006
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:14,840
多么可惜的浪费
Such a pitiable waste.

1007
01:37:28,190 --> 01:37:30,730
你怎能为帝国卖命？
How could you serve the empire?

1008
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:34,020
他们都做了些什么！
After everything they did?

1009
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:38,190
我不怪他们 夺得别人的馈赠
I do not fault them for taking what was given.

1010
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,900
我怪罪那些馈赠他们的人
I fault the man who gave it.

1011
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:45,490
那个躲在城墙之后的人
The man who cowered behind his wall...

1012
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:49,540
抛弃了我们 只为保住他的王位和儿子
...and abandoned us to save his throne and his son.

1013
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:53,170
把戒指给我 我们的家园将重获自由
Give me the ring, and our homes will be free again.

1014
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,630
皇帝承诺如此
The empire has promised it.

1015
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,220
在这个承诺上 我看不到什么未来
I don't see much of a future on the other side of that promise.

1016
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:01,970
别作傻瓜
Don't be a fool.

1017
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:03,770
救救你的朋友们吧
Save your friends.

1018
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:06,930
也让你死去的妹妹安息
Give your dead sister peace.

1019
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:10,860
否则你为什么而战？
What do you fight for if not that?

1020
01:38:56,110 --> 01:38:58,570
坐稳了 前面很颠簸
Hang on. This could get bumpy.

1021
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:09,920
德劳托斯
Drautos.

1022
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:19,830
给，你来开车
Here, take the wheel.

1023
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:29,890
油门踩到底！
Floor it!

1024
01:39:40,190 --> 01:39:42,770
-利波特斯！ -踩住油门别放
-Libertus! -Just keep your foot on the gas.

1025
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:05,100
你没事吧？
You're all right?

1026
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:13,600
我等着你，英雄
I'll be waiting for you, hero.

1027
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,620
你那众王的力量怎么了？
What of your kings' power now?

1028
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,510
他们交给你的重担 你根本担不起
They've given you a burden you cannot hope to bear.

1029
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:49,720
我曾经告诉你
I told you before.

1030
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:53,190
仅凭愿望 是无法赢得战争的
Just wanting doesn't win wars.

1031
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:11,770
为了我的家园的荣耀 我为了一位我所厌恶的国王四处攻杀
For the honor of my home, I fought and killed under a king I loathed.

1032
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:15,890
但是他仍然背弃了我
And still he betrayed me.

1033
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:19,220
他背弃了我们所有人
He betrayed us all.

1034
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:23,100
我们都在为同样的东西而战
We fought for the same thing. All of us.

1035
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,480
但你对过去看得太多
But you've looked too long on the past.

1036
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,690
对未来完全无视
You're blind to the future.

1037
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,530
太容易被猜透了
Predictable.

1038
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:39,990
和你不一样 我从历史中学习
Unlike you, I learn from history.

1039
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:43,170
但你是往事的奴隶
But you're a slave to the past.

1040
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,720
一个人的往事是他的荣耀
A man's past is his pride.

1041
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:48,470
不
No.

1042
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:52,510
我的荣耀在于塑造未来
My pride is shaping the future.

1043
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:07,450
看来我要亏欠他许多了
Looks like I'm gonna owe him big.

1044
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,080
我们就快到了
We're almost there.

1045
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:26,880
快到了
Almost.

1046
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,770
雷吉斯王为了未来 做了他该做的事
King Regis did what he did for the future.

1047
01:43:43,770 --> 01:43:45,690
因为他
Because of him...

1048
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:49,310
我们的家园还有希望
...there's still hope for our homes.

1049
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,270
希望…
Hope....

1050
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:03,620
这样死去倒也不算太坏
Not the worst way to go.

1051
01:44:04,290 --> 01:44:06,340
好好统治吧，年轻的国王
Rule well, young king.

1052
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:28,310
我们该走了
We should move.

1053
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:32,600
这里也不安全
It ain't safe here either.

1054
01:44:35,070 --> 01:44:36,440
嘿
Hey.

1055
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:39,410
别担心尼克斯
Don't worry about Nyx.

1056
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,870
他会照顾好自己的
He can take care of himself.

1057
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,410
走吧
Come on.

1058
01:44:51,670 --> 01:44:52,920
不
No.

1059
01:44:55,630 --> 01:44:57,590
我们必须分开了
We must part ways here.

1060
01:44:58,390 --> 01:44:59,680
什么？
What?

1061
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:04,060
有你这位大英雄为伴 我怎么能秘密前行？
I can hardly travel in secrecy alongside so great a hero.

1062
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:08,190
我也要为尼克斯信守一个承诺
And I, too, have a promise to keep to Nyx.

1063
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:11,730
我祈祷你们俩很快会重逢
I pray you two see each other again soon.

1064
01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:16,150
是啊
Yeah.

1065
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:19,740
我也想
Me too.

1066
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:24,790
谢谢你，利波特斯
Thank you, Libertus.

1067
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:43,720
嘿，王后！
Hey, queen!

1068
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:47,760
随时欢迎你们到加拉哈来
You and the king are always welcome in Galahd.

1069
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:51,480
我和尼克斯会等着你们
Me and Nyx will be waiting for you.

1070
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:49,180
已经有很长时间了
It's been some while.

1071
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:52,560
你还记得上一次看见露娜弗雷亚夫人 是在什么时候吗？
Do you remember the last time you saw Lady Lunafreya?

1072
01:54:53,150 --> 01:54:54,650
大概十二年前
About 12 years ago.

1073
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:56,660
也就是说 在你八岁的时候？
That would make you 8?

1074
01:54:56,820 --> 01:54:59,280
-你们那时还是小孩子 -希望她别抱太大希望
-You were kids. -Hope she hasn't gotten her hopes up.

1075
01:54:59,450 --> 01:55:01,200
为什么不？ 你要镇静
Why not? Calm yourself.

1076
01:55:01,410 --> 01:55:03,370
见到她时 你别太激动
Try and keep it together when you meet her.

1077
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:06,320
-她想见到一位得体的年轻王子 -你以为我不知道吗？
-She'll expect to see a fine, young prince. -Tell me something I don't know.

1078
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:08,740
我们没有时间扯这些
We don't have time for all that.

1079
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:11,580
但我们谈论的是你的婚礼
But this is your wedding we're talking about, Noc.

1080
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:13,590
这句也算
Knew that too.

1081
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:16,210
你真的需要冷静一下
You really gotta calm down.

1082
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:20,290
“啊哦”是什么意思？
What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

1083
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:22,220
我想我明白
I think I know.
