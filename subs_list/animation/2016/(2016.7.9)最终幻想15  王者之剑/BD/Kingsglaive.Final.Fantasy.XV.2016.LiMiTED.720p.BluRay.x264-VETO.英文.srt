1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,800
For centuries the sacred magic
of the Divine Crystal...

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,241
blessed our world and its people.

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,250
But in time the promise of its power
brought war to our lands.

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,684
Lucis, a peaceful kingdom of great magic
kept safe by the power of the crystal.

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,202
And Niflheim,
a military empire of vast machinery...

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,006
made strong by the might of its Magitek.

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,330
Long has war raged between the two.

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,122
As the years passed,
Niflheim marched on nearby nations...

9
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,368
driven by its unsurpassed technology.

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,051
To defend itself,
Lucis raised a magical wall...

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,284
the strength of which comes
from the crystal itself.

12
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,085
Insomnia alone, the crown city
and last bastion of Lucian defense...

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,170
remained beyond Niflheim reach
for many years.

14
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,689
Amid the escalating war...

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,320
Prince Noctis of Lucis
had come to Tenebrae...

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,801
to seek healing for a grievous injury.

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,404
He made the long journey
together with his father, King Regis.

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,330
Mother, brother, and I,
the royalty of Tenebrae...

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,482
had all welcomed their visit.

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,046
It was then that the fires came,
everywhere and all at once.

21
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,569
In a mere instant,
the whole of Tenebrae was ablaze.

22
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,049
Ravus!

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,443
Mother!

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,684
General Glauca.

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,484
The Niflheim attack was an attempt
on the lives of the visiting Lucian royalty.

26
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,969
Noctis!

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,608
Please. Help us!

28
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,250
King Regis!

29
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,970
Lunafreya....

30
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,043
Luna!

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,169
From that day until this day...

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,764
Tenebrae has been gripped
in the iron fist of Niflheim...

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,961
sworn enemy of Lucis.

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,049
King Regis assembles a force of mighty
warriors to combat the imperial menace.

35
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,644
Dubbed the Kingsglaive,
they fight relentlessly against Niflheim...

36
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,928
empowered by the magic of their sovereign.

37
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,929
All units, move to secure the Wall.

38
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,730
If they break through, we're done.

39
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,290
What's the hold-up, Crowe?

40
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,802
Crowe! Status?

41
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,161
Almost there.

42
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,241
No!

43
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,527
I need help. East wall's going down.
Pelna, can you get to me?

44
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,161
Lucis isn't paying us refugees enough...

45
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,326
for this.

46
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,401
How is this fair?

47
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,930
Nyx, I owe you one.

48
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,167
You and everyone else.

49
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,846
We need support on the east flank.
Nyx, where are you?

50
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,081
I'm on my way.

51
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,561
Pelna, fall back
and regroup with the others.

52
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,931
Go easy on the magic, hero.

53
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,923
You got people waiting for you back home.

54
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,411
I'm worth the wait.

55
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,881
Show-off.

56
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,564
Watch your back, Libertus.
We got more incoming.

57
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,724
We ain't gonna last much longer.

58
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,171
Crowe!

59
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,281
Yes!

60
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,766
All Glaives, fall back.
Repeat, all Glaives fall back!

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,604
Release the daemon.

62
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,046
We can't take down that daemon.
I'm ordering a full retreat.

63
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,526
Get back here alive. That's an order.

64
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,361
For hearth and home.

65
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,770
All units, fall back to the extraction point.
Support is inbound.

66
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,527
Nyx! We have to get out of here.

67
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,241
- Nyx! We have orders!
- Yeah.

68
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,441
Help!

69
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,601
Nyx!

70
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,166
That idiot.

71
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,766
Nyx!

72
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,889
Crowe. We gotta move.

73
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,086
You gotta be kidding me.

74
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,682
You know I ain't got
the stomach for this crap.

75
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,006
Would you rather walk?

76
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,162
Come on.
Just like Galahd Canyon back home.

77
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,726
Libertus!

78
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,648
Luche, report.

79
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,607
The imperial forces
look to be withdrawing, sir.

80
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,850
Guess I owe you another one.

81
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,204
I'll put it on your tab.

82
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,608
You just try and get some rest, all right?

83
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,047
You disobeyed a direct order to retreat.

84
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,130
For hearth and home, right, sir?

85
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,002
As long as I got strength in my body,
I obey that order.

86
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,967
Don't fool yourself, Nyx Ulric.

87
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,409
Whatever strength you have
is on loan from the king.

88
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,410
You are nothing without him.

89
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,202
Await details of your reassignment.

90
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,447
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,041
Despite their victory all but assured.

92
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,043
A sudden and inexplicable retreat.

93
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,807
We are at risk nonetheless, Your Majesty.

94
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,761
We cannot know
when they will strike again.

95
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,601
Your Majesty, word from the West Gate.

96
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,644
A man claiming to be an envoy
of the empire requests an audience.

97
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,560
The envoy from Niflheim awaits without,
Your Majesty.

98
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,920
Hello there.

99
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,205
Hello!

100
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,600
Good day to you...

101
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,201
and you.

102
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,368
Well met, my dear Lucians.

103
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,325
Has Niflheim grown so bold...

104
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,808
that they send the chancellor himself
as envoy?

105
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,288
And under no guard, at that?

106
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,530
It is an honor to be recognized
by the great King Regis.

107
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,442
Yet permit me to stand on ceremony
and introduce myself nonetheless.

108
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,484
Ardyn Izunia, Chancellor of Niflheim...

109
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,531
at your humble service.

110
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,769
And I come to you on this...

111
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,449
most auspicious of days
to offer terms of peace.

112
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,401
Peace?

113
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,042
As you no doubt surmised...

114
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,683
that recent maneuver of ours
was no strategic retreat.

115
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,044
Call it...

116
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,010
a gesture of imperial goodwill.

117
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,967
Like you, we wish nothing more...

118
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,887
than to bring a swift end
to this senseless war.

119
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,971
Is that so?

120
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,161
It is, indeed.

121
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,569
And we require but a singular compliance.

122
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,090
Save your grand Insomnia here.

123
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,764
Lucis must forfeit
all territories to Niflheim rule.

124
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,531
Insomnia!

125
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,446
The jewel in the crown
of the Lucian kingdom.

126
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,409
How foolish of me to forget.

127
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,803
There is just one more trivial thing.

128
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,331
It concerns your son.

129
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,484
The fetching Prince Noctis of Lucis...

130
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,366
and the fair Princess Lunafreya
of Tenebrae....

131
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,729
They are to be wed.

132
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,407
You seem vexed, Your Highness.

133
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,883
I assure you, the princess
still holds you in the highest regard...

134
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,448
as she has done all these 12 long years.

135
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,561
Don't know if anyone's told you...

136
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,485
but we don't take kindly
to insubordination around here.

137
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,083
Do yourself a favor, take a look around.

138
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,202
This is what a hundred years of peace
looks like.

139
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,649
It's a lasting peace made by the Wall
and the Wall alone.

140
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,800
See, we don't need any of you
immigrants...

141
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,404
jumping around, playing war hero.

142
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,490
Hey! Rough day on the gate, huh, Glaive?

143
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,521
You jerk.
It's your fault he got stuck there.

144
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,644
- Not a very nice welcome for a big hero.
- Not a very nice outfit for one, either.

145
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,404
I think it brings out my eyes.

146
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,166
What'd you put in this?

147
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,685
Tastes like a chocobo turd.

148
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,046
Hey, shut your trap!

149
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,365
This ain't Galahd.
That's the way folks around here like it.

150
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,367
Oh, well. I'm glad to see you're willing to
sell out our heritage for a few extra gil.

151
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,651
Hey, Libertus.
You thank Nyx for saving your life yet?

152
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,009
Oh, come on, Crowe.
Nyx and I are too close for that.

153
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,766
He helps me, I help him.
That's the way it's always been.

154
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,486
Looks like you got a little help
from something else, huh?

155
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,210
I need all I can get.

156
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,401
For hearth!

157
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,807
- And home.
- And home.

158
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,365
So, Nyx the Gatekeeper.
How's the new post treating you?

159
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,602
Oh, it's amazing. You guys would love it.

160
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,763
The gate watch are real sweethearts.

161
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,686
Yeah, right.

162
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,446
We all know they hate us outsiders
more than anything.

163
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,762
So bored they got nothing better to do.

164
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,490
Boredom's not so bad.

165
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,005
Means there's peace, at least.

166
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,124
I'd fight a hundred more wars
for Galahdans to know boredom.

167
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,966
Fight all you want.

168
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,491
Just don't go dying yet.

169
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,281
I still owe you.

170
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,841
A lot.

171
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,651
Where would the Glaive be
without its hero?

172
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,565
Can you not talk like this
while we're drinking, please?

173
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,929
We just sent the Niffs running
with tails between their legs, right?

174
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,845
They weren't running from us.
No, they were toying with us.

175
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,242
Stop being such a buzzkill, Luche.
We all know what happened.

176
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,171
Did you know they sent an envoy
to the Citadel after that?

177
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,846
What for? To offer their surrender?

178
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,365
- More like demand ours.
- What?

179
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,522
Demand? My ass!

180
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,524
No? Think about it.

181
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,843
The empire's got Lucis on its last legs.

182
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,162
It's the perfect time to make demands.

183
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,850
We are losing this war, Your Majesty.

184
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,449
Lucis cannot rely
on the Kingsglaive alone.

185
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,729
Accepting the truce may be
our best course of action.

186
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,447
You speak of matters beyond the New Wall.

187
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,441
We have no need of a truce here,
so long as it stands.

188
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,090
And if our position worsens,
we still have the Old Wall.

189
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,286
Yes, but this truce
will end the fighting altogether.

190
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,522
If only we could compromise...

191
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,603
Compromise is unwise.

192
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,604
We know nothing
of Niflheim's true intentions.

193
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,961
Do not fool yourselves.
The Walls are far from impenetrable.

194
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,449
The paths left to us are few.

195
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,801
The New Wall draws its power
from the throne.

196
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,881
I am able to sustain it for some years yet,
if the kingdom requires it.

197
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,121
But the chancellor spoke one truth,
if only one.

198
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,249
We are old, and the Old Wall....

199
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,526
I cannot command the Old Wall
with a weakened hand...

200
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,084
nor do I have the strength to muster
an offensive to turn the tide on this war.

201
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,001
Then let the choice be made, Your Majesty.

202
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,042
What are we to protect?

203
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,486
Help Mother!

204
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,210
How come you never
lose your lunch like that?

205
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,081
Just doesn't add up.

206
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,523
Here's this ancient art,
secret of the royal family and all that.

207
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,082
Libertus! Nyx!

208
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,610
Come here, guys, you gotta see this.

209
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,365
Things were hectic in the capital today...

210
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,284
as the Lucian government
announced full acceptance...

211
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,284
of what some are criticizing
as the unilateral peace terms...

212
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,488
proposed by Chancellor Izunia of Niflheim.

213
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,963
The signing of the truce will see
power over all Lucian territories...

214
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,363
transferred to the empire,
with the sole exception of Insomnia.

215
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,929
In return, Niflheim guarantees
the safety of Insomnia and its citizenry...

216
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,327
as well as a cessation
to all hostilities...

217
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,404
bringing a decisive end
to this long and bitter war.

218
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,047
All that fighting we did. All for nothing.

219
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,162
Glaives. Assemble in the briefing room.

220
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,561
Now.

221
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,090
The king has spoken, and you have heard.

222
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,803
All lands beyond the Wall
are to be relinquished to the empire.

223
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,889
Will no regions be spared?

224
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,887
- None.
- But your home's out there too!

225
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,241
It is.

226
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,084
Why would the king do this?

227
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,050
Because it'll end this damn war.

228
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,606
- Crowe.
- Sir!

229
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,921
Prepare to deploy.
You're being sent to infiltrate Tenebrae.

230
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,601
Tenebrae, sir?

231
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,283
Mission details are classified.

232
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,047
Report to my office for briefing
in 30 minutes.

233
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,605
And, Nyx....

234
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,566
You're off the West Gate.

235
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,491
You've been reassigned
to the castle guard.

236
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,766
That is all.

237
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,048
So this is what you were
talking about, Luche?

238
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,287
You heard the captain.

239
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,643
- This wasn't our decision to make.
- Not ours to make?

240
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,411
Those are our homes out there! Our people!

241
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,007
You're just gonna go along
and abandon them?

242
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,730
If we don't go along with them...

243
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,167
the empire will unleash all hell
on Insomnia.

244
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,687
- We'll unleash it right back at them!
- Easy, easy.

245
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,080
He's not the enemy.

246
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,770
Don't you get it?

247
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,210
We're nothing to them.

248
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,961
Rats, snuck in from beyond the Wall.

249
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,843
Sure, they had a use for us...

250
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,162
when they realized
we could work their magic.

251
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,085
So they handpicked us
from all the other rats out there...

252
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,041
and just let us nibble away
at his royal majesty's precious power.

253
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,808
But as soon as this war's all over...

254
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,407
it's back to the sewers for all of us.

255
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,489
That means you too, hero.

256
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,449
You missing home so much, Libertus,
why don't you and Nyx head on back?

257
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,001
I'm sure Niflheim will welcome you
with open arms.

258
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,243
You've got a home out there too.

259
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,851
Or did you forget?

260
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,126
Damn it!

261
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,883
I'm not gonna let it end like this.

262
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,243
It is said sentiment amongst the people
is favorable, Your Majesty.

263
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,681
Most all will welcome this peace.

264
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,450
If you yourself
have not heard their voices...

265
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,967
how can you claim to know their hearts?

266
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,047
What of the mission to Tenebrae,
Your Majesty?

267
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,522
Is such clandestine action wise?

268
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,610
If discovered, it will only serve
to provoke the empire.

269
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,969
The empire remains our enemy
until the treaty is signed.

270
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,690
So long as we are at war...

271
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,923
His Majesty intends to remain
one step ahead of them.

272
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,486
Of course.

273
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,524
A hairpin? I didn't think you were
into that kind of thing.

274
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,485
It's not for me.
It's a gift for the princess.

275
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,961
But keep that quiet.
Nobody's supposed to know.

276
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,325
Well, that's me.

277
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,725
Watch your back out there.

278
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,205
I know you're sick of hearing it,
but you're like a little...

279
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,807
Little sister to you.
Yeah, I am sick of hearing it.

280
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,166
Just make sure you come back
in one piece, all right?

281
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,406
Says the guy in two pieces.

282
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,885
Lady Lunafreya,
I have left the rear gate open.

283
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,041
Thank you.

284
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,207
Must you go?

285
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,361
Yes.

286
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,530
Then go quickly.

287
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,288
I do not recall granting you permission to
leave your quarters, Lunafreya.

288
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,280
Ravus.

289
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,770
You are not to leave this room again
until the journey to Lucis.

290
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,604
It is for your own good.

291
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,926
My own good?

292
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,329
What is truly going on here?

293
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,610
What cause does the empire have
to see me wed to Noctis?

294
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,168
They have offered a peace,
and your marriage is the olive branch.

295
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,244
You expect me to believe that?

296
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,443
What you believe does not concern me.

297
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,088
What does concern me
is you sneaking off...

298
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,323
to go tell our mother's killer
about some plot you've dreamt up.

299
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,967
You are wrong to hate King Regis.

300
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,405
Niflheim killed Mother, not him.

301
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,331
They murdered her
and made you their lapdog.

302
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,606
It's done.

303
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,402
An air of jubilation has swept the city
in anticipation of the coming armistice.

304
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,089
With only three days remaining until
the peace is officially signed into effect...

305
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,363
throngs of citizens
have taken to the streets to show....

306
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,920
Lucis needs your strength, young warriors.

307
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,445
We don't need any of you immigrants.

308
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,730
Whatever strength you have
is on loan from the king.

309
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,208
- You are nothing without him.
- Nyx, help Mother.

310
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,522
Selena, get down.

311
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,763
...and the waves of imperial diplomats
entering the city.

312
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,121
The princess? Are you certain?

313
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,964
Yes, Your Majesty.

314
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,444
She was amongst the last of
the imperial contingent to enter the city.

315
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,731
Get in.

316
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,165
I'm reporting to my post now though, sir.

317
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,044
New orders.

318
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,289
Come on. We've got a princess to pick up.

319
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,044
Nice ride, sir.

320
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,407
It belongs to the prince.

321
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,562
We've taken him outside the city.

322
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,008
Doesn't he have a wedding to plan, sir?

323
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,888
Cut the "sir" crap.

324
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,088
The king has a plan of his own.

325
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,722
Prince Noctis and Princess Lunafreya
are to meet far from Insomnia.

326
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,367
What's she doing here then?

327
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,847
Complicating things.

328
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,164
We sent Crowe to find the princess
and escort her out of Tenebrae.

329
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,410
We're still trying to figure out
what went wrong.

330
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,168
So I know what you think about this war,
but what do you think about this peace?

331
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,762
You happy giving up your home?

332
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,770
It's the king's decision.
I owe him for taking me in.

333
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,130
I was lucky.
There are people in Galahd who weren't.

334
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,367
And they need me.

335
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,762
So you're going back?

336
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,571
What good will you be
without the king's magic?

337
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,720
Yeah, always wanting to save somebody.

338
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,486
I get it. Believe me.
But it doesn't win wars.

339
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,041
It's not just wanting.

340
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,402
It's not just me.

341
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,768
Libertus is the one
you need to worry about.

342
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,531
He'll go back if things gets worse.

343
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,649
The worst is yet to come.

344
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,807
Do you have any idea who you're stopping?

345
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,487
Open this gate now,
and maybe you'll have a job tomorrow.

346
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,606
- King's orders.
- Are you sure you want to risk...

347
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,525
a diplomatic issue now, of all times?

348
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,969
I am the personal escort
of Lady Lunafreya Nox Fleuret...

349
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,566
princess of the former Tenebrae and...

350
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,604
And our kingdom's beloved bride-to-be.

351
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,725
Welcome to sovereign jurisdiction.
We'll take care of things from here.

352
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,326
- Forgive me, Captain Drautos.
- See Her Highness to the castle.

353
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,603
I had no idea that you...
I wasn't made aware of any...

354
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,882
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- No, you... I must...

355
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,048
I must... No, I have to clear it
with my superiors first.

356
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,770
Your Highness.

357
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,281
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae.

358
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,764
It has been a long time, Your Majesty.

359
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,450
Yes.

360
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,128
Far too long.

361
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,610
Prince Noctis isn't here, is he?

362
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,010
No, my dear. He is not.

363
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,249
I am too old to fight this war.

364
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,042
I have no choice but to receive the empire
and accept their treaty.

365
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,007
Even so...

366
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,207
I had hoped to hold the wedding
elsewhere, somewhere safe.

367
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,284
I sent one of my Glaive
to see you there, but...

368
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,969
It is not too late.

369
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,205
I can ready an escort.

370
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,761
Please, go to my son.

371
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,450
No.

372
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,042
Wherever I go, the empire will follow.

373
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,561
It would only place the prince
in greater danger.

374
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,241
It is my duty to protect the prince
and see his destiny fulfilled.

375
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,041
These 12 years have not changed that.

376
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,202
And what of your destiny?

377
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,209
My duty is my destiny, Your Majesty.

378
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,606
I'm prepared to accept
whatever may come to pass.

379
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,441
So, what do you think?

380
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,930
All these lands will be imperial soon.

381
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,289
Reckon things will get better
when them Niffs start calling the shots?

382
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,130
Not one damn bit.

383
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,408
Don't matter who's calling the shots.

384
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,483
Long as they're calling them
from behind the Wall...

385
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,291
ain't nothing gonna change around here.

386
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,486
Get over here.

387
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,210
All right.

388
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,604
That's a hand!

389
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,768
I trust the reunion was a happy one?

390
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,446
Has she been a hostage of Niflheim
all this time?

391
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,768
She is a symbol of the peace.
That's all I'm told.

392
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,921
Doesn't sound like it.

393
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,048
Sounds like she's here
for something much bigger than that.

394
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,328
Your orders are to protect her.

395
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,686
Not to look, not to listen, not to think.

396
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,524
Understood?

397
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,761
Drautos.

398
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,888
Yes, report.

399
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,643
Get the hell out of my way.
That's my friend you got in there, damn it.

400
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,763
Sir, you can't go in
until the examination has ended.

401
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,922
What examination?
What the hell's going on?

402
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,726
Hey, take it easy, big guy.

403
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,928
These bastards rushed Crowe in there
the moment she got back.

404
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,003
And now they won't let me in to see her.

405
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,725
Wait.

406
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,841
Crowe's personal effects.

407
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,163
Do with them as you see fit.

408
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,803
So, what kind of mission
did you really send her on?

409
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,731
No Glaive winds up dead
on a standard escort.

410
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,726
I'll see the armistice does not interfere
with a full investigation.

411
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,487
She was a good soldier.

412
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,406
Her death will not go unanswered.

413
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,922
What a life, huh?

414
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,006
She was brought up an orphan.

415
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,722
Run out of her village.

416
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,850
I still remember the first time I saw her.

417
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,082
Scrawny little thing...

418
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,368
all covered in dirt.

419
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,087
Not a friend in the world.

420
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,363
But those eyes....

421
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,210
Damn.

422
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,404
There was something about those eyes.

423
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,448
She deserved better.

424
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,927
And I would've done anything
to give it to...

425
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,646
Libertus, wait.

426
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,011
Crowe died a Glaive.

427
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,806
You can still honor her
by fighting as one.

428
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,563
You're dumber than me sometimes,
you know that?

429
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,643
Don't you get it?

430
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,400
Lucis killed Crowe.

431
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,688
Go back to the castle.

432
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,171
Tell the king there's no peace to be had
from throwing the weak to the wolves.

433
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,969
I'll fight my own fight from here on out.

434
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,287
See you around, hero.

435
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,521
A hairpin?

436
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,563
I didn't think you were
into that kind of thing.

437
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,041
It's not for me.
It's a gift for the princess.

438
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,448
A most grand reception, King Regis.

439
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,122
You honor all of Niflheim.

440
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,205
Oh, the honor is ours, Emperor Aldercapt.

441
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,762
You have ventured far
to grace us with your presence.

442
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,001
It was the very least I could do.

443
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,885
Tomorrow will be an historic day
for both our nations.

444
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,370
And your Insomnia is truly a marvel.

445
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,688
My own cities pale in comparison.

446
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,885
I pray we are able to take away much
from this visit.

447
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,411
Hello.

448
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,246
I am afraid we were never
properly introduced yesterday.

449
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,527
I'm afraid it's going to have to wait,
Your Highness. I'm on guard duty.

450
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,406
Then surely there's
no safer place for me to be.

451
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,643
May I ask your name?

452
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,324
Nyx. Nyx Ulric.

453
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,201
There is something else
I wish to ask you, Nyx Ulric.

454
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,885
King Regis said he sent
one of your order to come find me.

455
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,484
I should like to offer
my thanks in person.

456
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,486
Where might I find this brave soldier?

457
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,890
Oh, I did not...

458
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,287
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be.

459
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,767
Here.

460
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,248
She was carrying this.

461
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,326
It was meant for you.

462
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,850
For me?

463
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,011
Keep it.

464
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,762
She would've wanted you to have it.

465
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,360
I will carry it with me always.

466
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,210
Thank you.

467
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,770
Do you have any idea
what this peace means?

468
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,401
It means our homes are gone...

469
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,971
all of them...

470
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,849
forever.

471
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,442
Heard I could find
some treaty haters here.

472
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,122
I come to the right place?

473
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,009
You certainly have.

474
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,481
Everyone say hello to a man
who spends his days...

475
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,722
in the loyal service of our good king.

476
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,723
"Spent."

477
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,328
Those days are over.

478
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,520
I'm done listening to that bastard's lies.

479
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,365
He may sit on a throne,
but he ain't no king...

480
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,602
least not of mine.

481
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,730
Well, then...

482
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,045
welcome to the resistance, brother.

483
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,683
I hope you're here to talk.

484
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,611
What do you wanna know?

485
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,925
Please...

486
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,606
wherever Noctis is, keep him safe.

487
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,729
That is all I ask.

488
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,042
To what god do you pray?

489
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,926
You, the slave of fate and destiny.

490
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,721
Abandon your prayers.

491
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,649
The gods do not listen.

492
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,770
General Glauca. Why are you here?

493
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,885
You are far too clever
to have ever believed in this peace.

494
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,161
Pity you couldn't see your beloved Noctis.
You have another purpose.

495
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,051
- I'm not here for Niflheim.
- No.

496
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,531
You are here for me.

497
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,881
You?

498
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,451
I do not understand.

499
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,285
Come tomorrow, you will.

500
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,562
Niflheim contingent has left the hotel.

501
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,882
Less than three hours until the ceremony.

502
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,724
Bolster the Citadel guard.

503
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,724
Nyx, is the princess with you?

504
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,921
No.

505
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,531
I'm on duty at the Citadel.

506
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,122
Well, the Niffs just left
for the ceremony.

507
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,328
And she wasn't with them.

508
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,761
- A homing beacon?
- Yeah, I'll send the coordinates now.

509
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,410
Can you pinpoint a location for me?

510
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,801
Sure, but it sounds like
a wild-goose chase.

511
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,724
Guess you got some
free time on your hands, huh?

512
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,804
Guess I do, for better or worse.

513
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,726
Those coordinates are about
20 miles south of Insomnia.

514
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,650
Outside the Wall.

515
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,571
What the hell was Crowe doing
all the way out there?

516
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,763
No, no. They sent her to...

517
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,325
I need another favor, Pelna.

518
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,403
Pull those coordinates up on the radar
and let me know what you find.

519
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,325
On it. You're thinking
this is all a big deal now, huh?

520
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,646
Yeah, too big to ignore.

521
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,888
- Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

522
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,003
- Whoa, wait a minute.
- Stop right there.

523
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,650
Listen up. This is not the gate watch.

524
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,811
This is the heart of our city,
the home of our king.

525
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,645
The ceremony must not be disturbed.

526
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,122
Neutralize any threat quickly and quietly.

527
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,971
Is that understood?

528
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,929
Yes, sir.

529
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,563
Glaive to command. Are you there, captain?

530
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,165
Urgent.

531
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,969
Damn it, Drautos.

532
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,123
Jackpot, Nyx. There's a whole fleet of
airships sitting at that spot.

533
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,282
- Niflheim.
- Yup, and from the looks of it...

534
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,010
I'd say they're headed to war.

535
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,531
- Where's the captain?
- Should be at the Citadel.

536
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,011
There's no answer on his frequency.

537
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,367
I don't know, must have his hands full
with the escort detail.

538
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,121
Pelna, one last favor.
I need you to prep the Glaive for action.

539
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,441
What are you talking about?

540
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,329
You wanna deploy
without the captain's order?

541
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,851
Trust me. Just get it done.

542
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,729
Wait, what am I supposed to tell...?

543
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,967
Stand down, Glaive.

544
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,848
The ceremony is in less than two hours.

545
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,889
We must make ready.

546
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,090
Very well.

547
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,561
Your Majesty.

548
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,603
A man of the Kingsglaive is here, sire.

549
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,171
He demands an audience.

550
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,811
"Demands"?

551
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,481
- Your Majesty, please.
- Halt.

552
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,604
Give the order to deploy the Glaive.

553
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,891
You.

554
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,845
A Niflheim fleet makes ready for war
20 miles to the south.

555
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,764
An imperial fleet.

556
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,331
And they have the princess.

557
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,323
Clarus, post guards
outside the treaty room.

558
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,369
It will be seen
as a lack of faith in the peace.

559
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,164
Which we all harbor.

560
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,369
See it done.

561
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,127
We may well have to take
Emperor Aldercapt into custody.

562
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,005
Detain him?

563
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,481
That would go beyond
a new declaration of war.

564
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,041
We are still at war, Clarus.

565
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,483
And you, Nyx Ulric.

566
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,968
How soon can the Kingsglaive deploy?

567
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,607
On your word, at once.

568
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,764
Go, then.

569
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,485
Save Luna.

570
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,444
What if this is a diversion?

571
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,926
Not likely.

572
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,287
Tenebrae's princess is onboard.

573
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,330
We've got two jobs.

574
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,726
Save her.

575
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,364
And stop those Niff ships
from flying on Insomnia.

576
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,129
We go in teams.

577
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,764
Standard infiltrate and extract.

578
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,641
Nyx, you command. We'll follow.

579
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,282
The Glaive stands together, captain or no.

580
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,527
For hearth.

581
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,205
And home!

582
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,566
We are less than 20 minutes away
from the signing of this historic treaty.

583
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,208
I received word
of the king's order to deploy.

584
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,850
I'll see to matters in the city.

585
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,964
You have your mission,
and it won't be easy.

586
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,531
The objective is two-fold.

587
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,967
Secure the hostage,
and stay the enemy advance.

588
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,248
Just be careful.

589
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,767
One Glaive already died for this princess.

590
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,486
Niflheim won't give her up easily.

591
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,921
Team Two.

592
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,440
Oh, man.

593
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,290
Hurry up, Nyx!

594
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,925
Help!

595
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,610
Over here.

596
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,845
Preparing to head below deck.

597
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,685
Do not engage the enemy until instructed.

598
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,285
The ceremony is underway.

599
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,205
Let's wait and see
how Niflheim plays this.

600
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,368
The Kingsglaive
have infiltrated the ships.

601
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,921
So everything's going according to plan.

602
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:35,244
Ulric reporting. Six Niflheim airships
confirmed inbound for Insomnia.

603
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,970
Nyx, this doesn't feel like a war fleet.

604
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,930
I think I might've found her.
I got a guarded door here.

605
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,124
Two Niff MTs. What's the plan?

606
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,609
Hold position.

607
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,606
Arrived at destination.
High possibility of target in the vicinity.

608
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,487
Proceed to secure.

609
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,091
It's going to mean a fight.

610
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,886
Keep it quiet and keep it confined.

611
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,123
Pelna, you're clear to engage.
But keep it quiet.

612
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,129
I'm on my way.

613
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,284
Forgive my delay.

614
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,727
A bit of unforeseen trouble.

615
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,724
Nothing too vexing, I hope.

616
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,691
A simple theft, nothing more.

617
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,161
A daring thief, to steal from the king.

618
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,643
Perhaps magical walls and castle gates
do not keep all things safe.

619
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,365
Perhaps.

620
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,686
But no matter. That which was taken
will soon be returned.

621
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,683
Impressive.

622
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,050
You are a paragon of kingly composure.

623
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,722
But I must ask...

624
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,611
how can you be so sure?

625
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,050
Because this thing is no mere trinket.

626
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,044
It possesses a will all its own.

627
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,444
Enough to break any thief's grasp.

628
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,481
That sounds a very fine prize indeed.

629
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,771
Not now, damn it.

630
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,442
For me? You shouldn't have.

631
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,720
Target confirmed. She's unharmed.

632
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,362
The Glaives have recovered the princess,
Your Majesty.

633
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,321
Have you found your thief?

634
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,885
We have.

635
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,651
And what was stolen remains intact.

636
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,245
Joyous news.

637
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,880
I am relieved to hear it.

638
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,364
Tell me...

639
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,011
how heavy a sentence...

640
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,164
does the crime of theft
carry in your empire?

641
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,725
Among the heaviest.

642
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,201
Although there is one...

643
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,086
exception.

644
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,401
Things are about to get ugly over here.

645
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,648
Pelna, get out of there. It's a trap.

646
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,841
- What is that?
- A curious old law...

647
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,651
I still permit in the outlands.

648
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,690
A thief who escapes his captor...

649
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,446
can no longer be held to account
for his crime.

650
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,042
A warning to the victim.

651
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,529
Never show weakness,
lest you forgo the hand of justice.

652
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,007
Oh, no, good king.

653
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,082
Far from it.

654
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,323
The treaty is now on the table.

655
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,086
The countdown begins
to this historical moment.

656
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,370
It is a warning
to the hand of justice itself...

657
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,248
never to loose its grip.

658
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,809
Unit One, secure the perimeter.

659
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,803
Unit Two, stand your ground.

660
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,204
Pelna.

661
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,682
One Tenebrae princess, safe and...

662
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,441
Come on.

663
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,211
The crystal. They're after the crystal.

664
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,681
There's something going on below deck.

665
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,640
The ship's not going to make it
to Insom...

666
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,810
You....

667
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,445
What's going on?

668
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,846
Insomnia is under attack.

669
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,609
Who brought you here?

670
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,128
- General Glauca.
- You were bait.

671
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,521
Us coming here was all part of their plan.

672
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,087
Target secured.
Request permission to withdraw.

673
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,847
Granted. Get to...

674
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,641
The crystal will not serve you.

675
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,848
Nor you...

676
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,084
once I take it from this accursed city.

677
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,531
It's not the crystal I'm here for.

678
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,042
The Wall. It's gone.

679
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,400
Fall back. It's a trap.

680
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,648
What the hell is going on?

681
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,045
Traitors.

682
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,803
What's got into you?

683
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,441
Come, we must escape while we can.

684
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,284
No, Clarus.

685
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,927
I fear escape is no longer an option.

686
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,922
General Glauca.

687
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,002
Can you make it up? Can you stand?

688
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,970
Luche!

689
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,889
What are you doing?

690
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,002
You gotta be kidding me.

691
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,280
They teach piloting
back at the royal academy?

692
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,204
Give me that.

693
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,686
Been a long time
since I fought at your side, old friend.

694
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,245
Yes...

695
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,245
but this time it is not your fight.

696
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,129
If you wish to leave, go now.

697
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,523
And abandon my king? I think not.

698
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,167
Besides, our magic is bound to you.

699
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,041
If you fall, Lucis falls.

700
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,167
Then let us once more into the fray...

701
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,924
old friend.

702
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,847
You must take me back to King Regis.

703
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,731
Are you out of your mind?
Insomnia's a war zone.

704
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,726
I have a duty. I cannot neglect it.

705
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,168
- Yeah, I heard all that before.
- Then you know we must hurry.

706
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,209
Hurry to do what? Get yourself killed?

707
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,401
I do not fear death.

708
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,450
Enough with all this brave princess act.

709
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,926
Just pray this thing will make the trip.

710
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,011
Clarus.

711
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,044
Well, I daresay everything has proceeded
according to plan.

712
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,563
- No?
- So it has.

713
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,404
We have broken the Wall.

714
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,086
All that remains is to break the city.

715
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,361
Shall we take our leave, then?

716
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,568
The sun will soon set.

717
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,243
We need not be here
to witness the terrors of the night.

718
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,486
The crystal.

719
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,086
You're going too fast. We have to land.

720
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,211
- You're gonna have to give me a minute.
- There is no time. I will go on my own.

721
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,483
You got wings underneath that dress?
You can't use magic.

722
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,689
Not all miracles are made by magic.

723
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,569
I do not fear death.

724
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,644
What I fear is doing nothing
and losing everything.

725
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,046
Oh, come on.

726
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,647
You can thank magic for that miracle,
Your Highness.

727
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,491
The reckoning is at hand.

728
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,604
Dawn of a new age.

729
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:11,088
You have the crystal.
What more would you take from me?

730
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,807
The Ring of the Lucii.

731
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,284
I lost my mother, my country,
my birth-right.

732
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,881
Niflheim was the only life left to me.

733
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,722
But all of that was for this.

734
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,450
The ring belongs to me now.

735
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,761
Hear me, Lucian kings of old,
for I am Ravus Nox Fleuret...

736
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,322
and none is more worthy of your power
than I.

737
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,442
No. Why?

738
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,642
Why do you refuse me?

739
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,165
Look out.

740
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,410
Quickly, through here.

741
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,688
This leads to a hidden passageway.

742
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,927
Follow it.

743
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,809
Once you are away, make for Altissia.

744
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,200
Noctis awaits you there.

745
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,287
- Your Majesty.
- You knew this was coming...

746
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,444
Yes. But it was the only way
to draw their wrath from Noctis.

747
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,327
Is that the way of our king?

748
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,729
Sacrifice Lucian sons to save his own?

749
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,564
To save the world.

750
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,809
See Luna safely to Altissia.

751
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,491
This is not an order
from a king to his Glaive.

752
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,167
This is a plea from one man to another.
Please, Nyx Ulric, keep her safe.

753
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,004
For the future of all.

754
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,969
The future?

755
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,564
Here.

756
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,166
Take this.

757
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,881
It is time it passed to another's keeping.

758
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,409
No, please. Stop.

759
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,489
- Get back.
- Please. Don't leave us.

760
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,484
I know your mother
would wish the same as me.

761
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,487
That you and Noctis live happily.

762
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,684
All those years captive
because I failed you.

763
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,887
Not again.

764
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,930
Locked doors
will seal your fate no longer.

765
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,003
King Regis....

766
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,889
Our hope goes with you now,
Nyx Ulric. Godspeed.

767
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,850
Behold the King of Lucis...

768
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,605
who hoarded tranquility
within his precious walls.

769
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,603
Where is your tranquility now, king?

770
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,684
Here is your peace,
by steel's swift descent.

771
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,244
Go.

772
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,642
No. We must get away from here.

773
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,603
It is what your king wanted.

774
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,243
Lady Lunafreya has escaped with the ring.

775
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,966
Find her at once.

776
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,565
She is not to leave the city.

777
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,685
- Ulric to command. Come in, captain.
- Footage of the perpetrators...

778
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,882
was captured
by a nearby surveillance camera.

779
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,008
Here are images of the six suspects.

780
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,049
One has been identified
as Galahdian refugee, Libertus Ostium...

781
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,602
a former member of the Lucian Kingsglaive.

782
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,529
Hey, come here. Come here.

783
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,682
I got you, I got you. You're all right.

784
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,524
You're okay.

785
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,685
It's fine.

786
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,080
We're free.

787
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,045
We're free now.

788
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,208
We're free? What do you mean,
"We're free"?

789
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,931
The empire. They promised.

790
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,730
This district's ours.

791
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,650
All the refugees.

792
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,643
It's our new home.

793
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,409
- The empire? You went in with Niflheim?
- Here.

794
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,681
Take this. Meet up with the others.

795
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,809
You're the hero
of our revolution, brother.

796
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,967
Damn it.

797
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,290
This guy just doesn't know when he's beat.

798
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,724
- Can you drive?
- I can try.

799
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,691
I'll be right back.

800
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,246
No warping for you this time, hero.

801
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,082
Give me the wheel. Go.

802
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,165
You are without your magic.

803
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:13,006
You noticed that, huh?
It must have died with the king.

804
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,607
You're making a mess of my city, Glaive.

805
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,489
I thought I told you
not to go playing hero.

806
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,326
Leave the ship to me.

807
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,207
Looks like you got a royal fare to see to.

808
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,091
Move it.

809
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,125
Maybe not all miracles are made by magic.

810
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,770
Oh, great.

811
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,968
The hell did you do
to piss these things off?

812
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,885
It's not me they're after. It's the ring.

813
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,522
What's so special about this ring?
Don't tell me the future's riding on it.

814
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,489
He who wears the ring
communes with the Lucii...

815
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,961
- ...and commands great power.
- What kind of power?

816
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,010
A forbidden one.
Sealed within the ring, long ago.

817
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,123
The Old Wall.
I thought that was just a bedtime story.

818
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,210
I can assure you it is not.

819
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,489
But the Lucii grant their power
only to those they deem worthy.

820
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,802
So that guy who tried it on back there...

821
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,803
I guess he wasn't deemed worthy.

822
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,646
That was my brother.

823
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,642
These 12 years have changed Ravus.

824
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,730
He is bound by the past,
and lost in his lust for power.

825
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,285
How the hell did they find us?

826
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,566
Your hairpin. They're tracking it.
Give it to me.

827
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,370
I had a little sister once.
She was killed when the empire came.

828
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,009
I couldn't save her.

829
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,884
I was as helpless then as I am now.

830
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:49,125
I couldn't show her the future she wanted.

831
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,285
True power is not something that is found
by those who seek it.

832
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,931
It is something that comes
to those who deserve it.

833
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,967
Your sister wanted you to see
a future as well.

834
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,964
Anyone would wish the same
for family they love.

835
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,811
You don't pull any punches, do you?

836
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,045
I'm over here.

837
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,562
Do you hear me? Repeat, this is Drautos.

838
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,051
Can you hear me? Over.

839
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,408
Your timing's impeccable, captain.

840
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,490
If the Lucii are real...

841
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:42,484
they sure don't seem to mind
their city getting torn apart.

842
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,608
You're to rendezvous and regroup.
Understood?

843
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,570
Might not be so easy, captain.

844
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,122
My wings have been clipped,
if you didn't know.

845
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,164
Ulric. Are you all right?

846
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,802
I'm not dead,
if that's what you mean, sir.

847
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,762
Head for Section D as soon as you can.

848
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,207
I'll have an evacuation team ready.

849
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,200
Don't suppose you could meet me
at the gate.

850
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,721
I'd kind of like to
get the hell out of this city.

851
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,565
Imperials hold all exits.
There's no way through.

852
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,960
I'll meet you at Section D.

853
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:55,205
Cut all radio contact until then.
And make sure you get there.

854
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,407
It's a date, sir.

855
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,527
Ain't no turning back now.

856
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,006
Status report.

857
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,162
Ulric killed some good men.

858
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,561
- What about the ring?
- We don't have it yet.

859
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,121
This is Glauca. King Regis is dead.

860
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,880
The ring is on its way to Section D.

861
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,611
We must recover the ring
to realize our goal.

862
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,604
If Ulric or the princess get in the way,
take them out.

863
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,047
Reclaim our hearth and home.

864
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,163
"Hearth and home"?

865
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,446
Libertus, come in.

866
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,284
Where are you? Are you all right?

867
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,771
I'm fine.

868
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,529
On the way back to base now.

869
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,160
We need you to head to the junction
in Section D.

870
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,529
We're gonna join with another unit,
make a clean sweep of the place.

871
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,331
We're one step away
from realizing this revolution.

872
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,721
Let's not let Pruvia's death be in vain.

873
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,121
We'll be waiting for you, hero.

874
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,964
- Don't move until I say it's safe, all right?
- I won't.

875
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,124
Ulric, reporting.

876
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,442
I have the princess.

877
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,722
She's alive and well.

878
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,931
- No!
- Get out of here.

879
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,646
You've got some fight in you, Nyx,
I'll give you that.

880
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,250
Run. Now.

881
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:09,250
I can't believe you're still moving
with that hollowpoint in you.

882
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,086
All Crowe could do was scream,
when one tore her insides apart.

883
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:18,206
- Why'd you do it?
- Because the Kingsglaive is nothing.

884
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,964
An old man's battle fodder...

885
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,884
sent to die in Insomnia's war...

886
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,804
while our homes are bound and shackled.

887
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,689
Niflheim took your home.

888
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,803
Took all our homes!

889
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,763
Nothing will ever change that.

890
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,963
You never were too smart.

891
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,325
You could've had a new future
with the empire.

892
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:00,370
There's nowhere to run, princess.

893
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,881
The ring.

894
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,650
Give it to me.

895
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,803
So many dead over so simple a thing.

896
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,163
But why? For what?

897
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,364
Power.

898
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,206
Untold power,
beyond the control of someone like you.

899
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,725
Power....

900
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,764
Captain.

901
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,205
Nyx.

902
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,361
It's over. The daemons are unleashed.

903
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,886
Lucis is fallen.

904
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,451
Surrender the ring.

905
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,125
Plan on giving those kings
a piece of your mind, princess?

906
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,929
You got a destiny to take care of here,
remember?

907
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,403
Besides, didn't anyone tell you?

908
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,845
I'm the hero around here.

909
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:35,042
Show yourselves, kings of Lucis.

910
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,683
You call upon the wards
of this world's future, mortal.

911
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,602
And if you come lusting for our power,
you must first stand in our judgment.

912
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,642
How long will you do nothing
whilst Insomnia burns?

913
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,481
Old or new, or whatever it is.

914
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,688
Summon your Wall.

915
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,924
You do not command us.

916
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:04,289
Yours is not even royal blood.

917
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,523
It does not fall to us to guard your city.

918
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,170
Man is a fool creature...

919
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,369
clinging to his past
and cowering from his future.

920
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:16,127
Wasting his strength on bygone days.

921
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,285
And what future are you wards of?

922
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,771
So shortsighted.

923
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,281
And cursed never to rise above it.

924
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,606
Wait.

925
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,122
I have seen what this brave soul
is prepared to do.

926
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,045
He, too, seeks to safeguard the future.

927
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,440
Your Majesty.

928
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:37,046
Very well, young king.
We will weigh your warrior's worth.

929
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,766
But our boon does not come cheap.

930
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:46,127
The cost is a life. His or hers.

931
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:47,970
No.

932
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,682
To hell with your power.

933
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,042
I'm not here for it.

934
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:00,604
I only came to tell you, you are no kings.

935
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,170
Your worth has been weighed
and found wanting.

936
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,089
Now burn.

937
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,051
You're going to lose your precious ring.

938
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,605
But it's not too late to save it.

939
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,482
You mean to barter for your life.

940
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,608
No, no.

941
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,768
My life is nothing.

942
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,648
Giving a future
to those who want to see it...

943
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,084
is everything.

944
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,482
You do not fear,
even if that future is doomed.

945
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:47,725
If that sentiment is not false,
perhaps you are worthy.

946
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,726
We will grant you our light.

947
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,804
But know it will set when the sun rises.

948
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,642
And the price for it will be your life.

949
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,850
You guys drive a hard bargain.

950
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,443
Where do I sign?

951
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,607
I could get used to this.

952
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,201
Nyx....

953
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,169
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

954
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,010
You saved me.

955
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,005
Now I owe you.

956
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,850
For a change.

957
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,371
I'm gonna need another favor.

958
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,770
Meet Lunafreya Nox Fleuret,
our prince's beloved bride-to-be.

959
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,844
And she has the future of the world
in her hands.

960
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,402
Keep her safe, get her out of Insomnia.

961
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,447
Oh, I almost forgot. You'll need this.

962
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,330
Give Prince Noctis my regards.

963
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,128
Libertus will take care of you from here.

964
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,449
Have a safe journey, Your Highness.

965
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,890
- What will come of you?
- What the hell are you doing?

966
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,408
Following the kings' orders.

967
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,680
I will see the ring to Noctis.

968
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,321
The future will be safe. I swear it.

969
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,444
Planning on punching your way
out of the city? Keep it.

970
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,923
- Now we're even.
- No.

971
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,687
We'll settle up
once you're back in Galahd.

972
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,406
Me and everyone else
will be waiting for you.

973
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,965
I'm counting on you...

974
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,367
hero.

975
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:03,369
- Buckle up, princess.
- My life is in your hands.

976
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:16,562
So, the power of the Lucii returns.

977
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,724
No matter. You are out of time.

978
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,962
For you, I'll make some.

979
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,127
What can you hope to do?

980
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:01,564
One man against an empire.

981
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,529
Against the daemons.

982
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,771
How will you save Insomnia
with no wall to protect you?

983
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,365
You've got it all wrong.
I'm not fighting to save Insomnia.

984
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:44,440
So this is the might of the Old Wall.

985
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:48,321
Marvelous. Truly marvelous.

986
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,402
Why'd you do it?

987
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,001
Lucis. Niflheim.

988
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:06,845
It isn't who we fight for that matters,
only what.

989
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,890
We fight for our homes.
That is where our allegiance lies.

990
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,766
That's not something you see every day.

991
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,322
Oh, such a pitiable waste.

992
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:58,247
All those beautiful city streets,
all laid to unsightly ruin.

993
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:01,808
- I will return to Niflheim.
- So soon?

994
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,164
The crystal is ours.

995
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,246
Finish this...

996
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,040
and see the daemons disposed of.

997
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,565
As you command.

998
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,846
Such a pitiable waste.

999
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,731
How could you serve the empire?

1000
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:34,005
After everything they did?

1001
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:38,207
I do not fault them
for taking what was given.

1002
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,891
I fault the man who gave it.

1003
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,488
The man who cowered behind his wall...

1004
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:49,526
and abandoned us
to save his throne and his son.

1005
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:53,164
Give me the ring,
and our homes will be free again.

1006
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,641
The empire has promised it.

1007
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,211
I don't see much of a future
on the other side of that promise.

1008
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,970
Don't be a fool.

1009
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,770
Save your friends.

1010
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,929
Give your dead sister peace.

1011
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,850
What do you fight for if not that?

1012
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,560
Hang on. This could get bumpy.

1013
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,930
Drautos.

1014
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,844
Here, take the wheel.

1015
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,889
Floor it!

1016
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,771
- Libertus!
- Just keep your foot on the gas.

1017
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,090
You're all right?

1018
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,602
I'll be waiting for you, hero.

1019
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,650
What of your kings' power now?

1020
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,486
They've given you a burden
you cannot hope to bear.

1021
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,729
I told you before.

1022
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:53,163
Just wanting doesn't win wars.

1023
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:11,767
For the honor of my home,
I fought and killed under a king I loathed.

1024
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,880
And still he betrayed me.

1025
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:19,208
He betrayed us all.

1026
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:23,086
We fought for the same thing. All of us.

1027
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,482
But you've looked too long on the past.

1028
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,680
You're blind to the future.

1029
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,524
Predictable.

1030
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:40,006
Unlike you, I learn from history.

1031
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:43,171
But you're a slave to the past.

1032
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,725
A man's past is his pride.

1033
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,441
No.

1034
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:52,526
My pride is shaping the future.

1035
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,441
Looks like I'm gonna owe him big.

1036
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,084
We're almost there.

1037
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:26,880
Almost.

1038
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,769
King Regis did what he did for the future.

1039
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,683
Because of him...

1040
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:49,330
there's still hope for our homes.

1041
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,289
Hope....

1042
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,601
Not the worst way to go.

1043
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,328
Rule well, young king.

1044
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,325
We should move.

1045
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:32,601
It ain't safe here either.

1046
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,445
Hey.

1047
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,402
Don't worry about Nyx.

1048
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,887
He can take care of himself.

1049
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,411
Come on.

1050
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:52,920
No.

1051
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,608
We must part ways here.

1052
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:59,691
What?

1053
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:04,046
I can hardly travel in secrecy
alongside so great a hero.

1054
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:08,169
And I, too, have a promise to keep to Nyx.

1055
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:11,721
I pray you two see each other again soon.

1056
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,170
Yeah.

1057
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:19,724
Me too.

1058
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,761
Thank you, Libertus.

1059
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,726
Hey, queen!

1060
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,768
You and the king
are always welcome in Galahd.

1061
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,485
Me and Nyx will be waiting for you.

1062
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,167
It's been some while.

1063
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:52,569
Do you remember the last time
you saw Lady Lunafreya?

1064
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,645
About 12 years ago.

1065
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,643
That would make you 8?

1066
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,280
- You were kids.
- Hope she hasn't gotten her hopes up.

1067
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,204
Why not? Calm yourself.

1068
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:03,368
Try and keep it together
when you meet her.

1069
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:06,330
- She'll expect to see a fine, young prince.
- Tell me something I don't know.

1070
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,721
We don't have time for all that.

1071
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:11,571
But this is your wedding
we're talking about, Noc.

1072
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,563
Knew that too.

1073
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,206
You really gotta calm down.

1074
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:20,281
What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

1075
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:22,204
I think I know.
