1
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,117
What's causing this?

2
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,520
It's the magic of darkness.

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,623
It's a terribly potent spell
that turns people into demons

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,125
using the Black Rukh.

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,230
Move it!

6
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,166
I'll never betray my comrades.

7
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,103
You fool! Listen to yourself.

8
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,572
If we allow the demon
to become whole, then...

9
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,506
Enough.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,277
They promised to join me
to change the world.

11
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,612
This monster isn't human anymore!

12
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,750
It doesn't matter
if they're a monster or a human,

13
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,318
they're my comrades!

14
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,222
What's going on?

15
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,424
What's with this destructive force?

16
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,905
This won't work!

17
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,842
Sinbad! Use the Djinn's power!
We're left with no choice!

18
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,713
If we don't defeat it, we'll die!

19
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,816
Wrong. There's another way.

20
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:03,817
What?

21
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,855
That demon keeps
the humans alive in its core

22
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,192
and sucks the energy out of them.

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,562
The core is most likely near its chest.

24
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,866
If you can destroy that in one shot,
you can save all of them!

25
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,322
All right!

26
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,858
Bararaq.

27
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,373
Here we meet again.

28
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,443
Feeling powerless?

29
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,378
The sorcerer, Falan.

30
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,751
I knew it!

31
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,790
Yes, my physical body is in Parthevia.

32
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,794
I'm the sorcerer appointed
to serve General Barbarossa.

33
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,429
My brother?

34
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,831
Commander Dragul,

35
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,735
I heard you've earned your rank
as a captain.

36
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,839
Captain? What are you talking about?

37
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,644
<i>You're considered killed in action,
<i>Junior.

38
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,614
Brother! Is that you?!

39
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,717
You failed to capture the first dungeon.

40
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:47,921
You also failed to arrest
Sinbad the Capturer.

41
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:53,994
<i>You've proven yourself to be a disgrace
<i>to our noble Dragul family.

42
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,563
And regarding my wife...

43
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:02,402
It's obvious to me that you...

44
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,337
have feelings for Serendine.

45
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,475
<i>You became too close to her.

46
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,443
<i>That woman belongs to me.

47
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,880
<i>Know your place.
<i>I suggest that you die like a man.

48
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,717
You're all sacrificial pawns.

49
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,821
There's no "home" waiting for you.

50
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,692
Drakon!

51
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,930
Hina!

52
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,336
You should've defeated the demon
with this sword.

53
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,339
Like I said,

54
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,107
I'll never...

55
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,009
leave anyone behind!

56
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,750
<i>Sinbad.

57
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,852
<i>You're always this way.

58
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,656
<i>Strong-willed and focused on your goals.

59
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,794
<i>If a human like you obtained
<i>the king's power...

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,864
<i>I used to think I could be king,
<i>but now I know.

61
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:09,069
<i>Even if I obtain the king's power,
<i>I can't be like you. Not even close.

62
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,506
<i>I was running from that reality.

63
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,509
<i>I get it now, Sinbad.

64
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,147
I said...

65
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,418
I get it now!

66
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,622
Hina.

67
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,459
It's always trouble with you.

68
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,463
You meddle with my business all the time.

69
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,633
Remember when you killed
that Abare narwhal?

70
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,069
Then you followed me to the dungeon
without my consent.

71
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,537
And now...

72
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,941
you're fighting with that tiny,
fragile body of yours.

73
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,710
But...

74
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,980
you're truly an amazing man.

75
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,054
<i>You must be the King Vessel.

76
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,990
Sin! I'll take care of him!

77
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,027
I'm the only one who can pierce
through him now!

78
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,698
Okay, then I'll distract him!

79
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,436
<i>This is it!

80
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,673
This is becoming quite the eyesore.

81
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,651
What? How is he dodging all the attacks?

82
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,654
As if he can clearly see what's coming.

83
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:35,989
If that's the case...

84
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,060
Sinbad!

85
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,729
No! Not yet!

86
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,064
But...

87
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,600
Don't move if you want to finish him
in one shot!

88
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,938
I'll let you die instantly.

89
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:55,942
Die.

90
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:01,881
Drakon!

91
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,920
I've always fought for my country.

92
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,557
It was my ambition to die for my country.

93
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,258
But I was wrong.

94
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,028
I really need to protect...

95
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,529
I won't accept death.

96
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,533
Barbarossa! I'll never give up!

97
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,937
<i>I'll escape the dungeon to kill you,

98
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,740
<i>no matter what it takes!

99
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,578
Come back, all of you!

100
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,714
I know you're not lightweights

101
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,183
who'd fall for this kind of deception!

102
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,761
What do they think they're doing?!

103
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,836
Sorry for the wait.

104
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,608
Behold, the Great Harpoon
of the Imuchakks!

105
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,711
<i>I'm not the same anymore.

106
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,246
<i>Now I can...

107
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,552
<i>finish him!

108
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,235
What have you done to my demon?!

109
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,171
Time for you to go, too!

110
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,278
I'll have it back.

111
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,786
They're still breathing.

112
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,024
Are you conscious?

113
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:53,860
Hey.

114
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,864
Sinbad... did you save us?

115
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,032
Are you okay?

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,038
I feel refreshed,
as if an evil spirit has been released.

117
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,773
<i>An evil spirit?

118
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,609
What's that?!

119
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,983
-Another black matter?
-Chief!

120
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:17,984
Impossible!

121
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,957
The demon's... resurrected!

122
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:31,030
<i>I've recreated the core
<i>with the power source's element!

123
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:35,301
<i>And this boy was already falling.

124
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,371
<i>He's ideal core material.

125
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,141
What? Already falling?

126
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,744
<i>The boy itself becomes the core.

127
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,049
Defeating the demon equals
the death of this boy.

128
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,886
So, what now?

129
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,694
Hey, what are you gonna do?

130
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,197
Maybe...

131
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,772
<i>Is he going to pull the kid out?

132
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,309
Stop! A human's body can't handle that!

133
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,825
<i>What's this?

134
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,129
<i>Something's going on inside my head.

135
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,465
This is the boy's memory.

136
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:43,469
We're delving deep into his psyche.

137
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:44,804
Baal.

138
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:51,010
Master, you must talk to him.
You must save this boy.

139
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:56,115
Or else he'll fall and never return
from the darkness.

140
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,265
It hurts.

141
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,234
I don't want to do this anymore.

142
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:20,873
Mom, Dad, where are you?

143
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,181
Where are you?!

144
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,850
-No...
-Hey.

145
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,752
Quit crying!

146
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,887
Shut it! You loser!

147
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,459
But... I don't want this anymore.

148
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,361
I wanna go home.

149
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,063
Home? Where's that?

150
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,299
Face the truth!

151
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,135
Don't forget that we killed

152
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,171
our father and mother!

153
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,276
Kill them, Ja'far! Kill them!

154
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,781
We are children born into the force.

155
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,784
We had to murder our parents eventually.

156
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,487
You must show your power to survive!

157
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,992
There was no other choice.

158
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,429
There was no other...

159
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,903
Or else we couldn't have survived.

160
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,416
<i>This is what you've been hiding.

161
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,820
You've been suffering a life

162
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,123
of contradiction and lies.

163
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,060
Shut it! What do you know?!

164
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,464
You're right. There's no way I would know.

165
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,066
But...

166
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,205
if you don't have a home,
I'll provide it for you.

167
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:05,144
I'll be your guiding light. You don't have
to live a life of lies anymore.

168
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,213
Now that...

169
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,983
we've met.

170
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,495
Did you hear me?
I never let my comrades die!

171
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,932
That's why I'll never let you die!

172
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,938
He's using his whole body
to take the lightning!

173
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,173
Look!

174
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,577
The black matter's getting dispersed!

175
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,884
Stay! Stay with us!

176
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,919
You can't go yet, Ja'far!

177
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,318
Hey, are you alive?

178
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,256
Yeah.

179
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,294
You're nothing but trouble.

180
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,001
<i>Incredible.

181
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,271
<i>Did he really save that boy
<i>from falling into depravity?

182
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,940
<i>That man...

183
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,415
You've reached the treasure vault.

184
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:54,954
The sacred place where a King Vessel
forms a pact with the Djinn Valefor.

185
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:58,157
Let us choose the king.

186
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,699
Go, Sinbad.

187
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,502
Hina...

188
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:14,373
All of us here believe you're the king.

189
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:23,716
King! Now is the time to form a pact
with the Djinn.

190
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:33,226
I acknowledge you as my king!

191
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,499
SIXTH DUNGEON: VALEFOR

192
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,168
CAPTURE COMPLETE

193
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,347
We're back.

194
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,449
<i>What a strange feeling.

195
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,552
<i>We didn't spend that much time
<i>in the dungeon,

196
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,588
<i>but it feels very nostalgic here.

197
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,358
Welcome home!

198
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,069
Father.

199
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,305
I...

200
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:26,178
Let's go back to the village.
It's time for the ritual.

201
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,582
Please excuse me.

202
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,285
Wait up, Drakon!

203
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,224
We're enemies after all.

204
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,327
We joined forces in the dungeon,

205
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,096
but there's no reason to now.

206
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,798
Oh, really?

207
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,633
What's with those eyes?!

208
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,602
Oh, it's nothing, really.

209
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,105
<i>Stubborn as a mule.

210
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,742
Anyway, I'm going back to my country.

211
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,713
I know it's a risk, but back there...

212
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,116
I have someone I must protect.

213
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,121
I see. Good luck with that!

214
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,326
I'm certain we'll never meet again.

215
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,469
<i>Sinbad.

216
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,773
<i>If I were free,
<i>I would've made you my master.

217
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,510
<i>Oh, what am I saying?

218
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,714
<i>He'd put me through hell
<i>if he was my master.

219
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,456
<i>Household Members are attracted to kings
<i>who possess the Metal Vessels of a Djinn.

220
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:47,693
<i>The warrior who received the blessing
<i>of the king's Magoi and its Djinn,

221
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:53,399
<i>Drakon was the first in the world
<i>to obtain this power.

222
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,803
<i>But, wait, he still doesn't get

223
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,706
<i>to use those powers yet.

224
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,877
All right! Let's go home!

225
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,812
Yeah!

226
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,520
As you are now a noble Imuchakk warrior,

227
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,225
I grant you your symbol
and your sacred name.

228
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,293
Come forward, warrior.

229
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,503
The fangs and horns of an Abare narwhal
prove your status as a warrior.

230
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,273
The deep blue turban represents
the clear stream of the ocean.

231
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,444
That pattern is the shape
of an Imuchakk's soul.

232
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,447
Warrior, your name is Hinahoho.

233
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,786
This new name

234
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,756
means "as noble as the great ocean."

235
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,225
Go forth a faithful warrior.

236
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,560
I will!

237
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,667
Have some.

238
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,376
Chief!

239
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,945
Bottoms up!

240
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,981
Father.

241
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,686
No... Dad.

242
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,890
I've decided to leave Imuchakk.

243
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,661
My instincts are telling me to follow him.

244
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,232
I will become his sword, arm and shield,

245
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,267
and help him achieve his vision.

246
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,572
I want to create a new world with Sinbad!

247
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,476
You're a true Imuchakk warrior.

248
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,911
Nothing makes me happier.

249
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,694
IMUCHAKK CAPITAL

250
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,329
Chief Rametoto.

251
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,833
I, the warrior Hinahoho,
am grateful for your presence.

252
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,772
We're here to ask for your permission.
Will you allow us,

253
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,708
Hinahoho and Rurumu, to get married

254
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,511
and leave the Imuchakk clan?

255
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:22,748
Answer this question, Warrior Hinahoho.

256
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:27,620
What are you able to provide
for my daughter?

257
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,756
Money? Power? Status?

258
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,059
My daughter has been cultured

259
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,395
and trained to be a robust warrior.

260
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,965
She has everything you can think of.

261
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,770
So, what can you provide
for a person like her?

262
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:50,075
At the moment,
I'm unable to provide her with anything.

263
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,079
Bastard! Who, in his right mind,

264
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,448
would dare insult the chief?!

265
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,017
I'll mangle you!

266
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:03,556
I'm unable to provide her with anything
in my current state.

267
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:08,594
But we can both work together
to make our dreams come true.

268
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,996
That is my master's dream!

269
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,635
<i>Due to this conversation,

270
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,906
<i>Sinbad officially formed
<i>a monopoly agreement with the Imuchakk.

271
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,976
<i>Sinbad the Capturer spread
<i>his name worldwide,

272
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,078
<i>not only as an adventurer

273
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,814
<i>but also as a merchant.

274
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,450
<i>Later, the armada of merchant ships
<i>he created

275
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:36,488
<i>would be known
<i>as the Sindria Merchant Fleet.
