1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,753
Look! We're almost there, Sinbad!

2
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,258
Yeah.

3
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,670
Let's see, the Sasan Kingdom?

4
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,374
We gotta pass
through the mountains on foot.

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,776
What kind of business do we have there?

6
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,581
Sasan is known for producing
the world's finest metal.

7
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:52,185
But they've always closed their doors,
refusing to trade with other countries.

8
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:55,789
However, they seem to have
started trading with Reim recently.

9
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,094
If we get ahead
and figure out a working trade route,

10
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,263
we could expect to make huge profits.

11
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,098
But while we're gone,

12
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,267
is it gonna be okay to rely on

13
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,470
Vittel and Mahado
to take care of the company?

14
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,206
Rurumu's there,
but she's gotta look after our son.

15
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,375
She can't be working.

16
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,544
It'll be fine.

17
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,815
Vittel supports the company
as the accountant.

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:27,354
Mahado's quiet, but he's a helpful man
who's well-liked by other employees.

19
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,124
Plus... it'll be our first visit
to this country.

20
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,861
I should be present
as the head of the company... right?

21
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,830
All right, let's go!

22
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:42,369
You say that, but I know that you just
want to go on an adventure!

23
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,439
It's an exciting feeling, isn't it?!

24
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,275
He'll always be a kid.

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,615
That's the summit.

26
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,586
We've arrived...

27
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,727
...at Sasan Kingdom, the land of purity!

28
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,493
<i>Sasan Kingdom...

29
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:51,531
<i>is a city-state constructed
<i>in ravines of high elevation.

30
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,969
<i>Sasan is also a religious country
<i>with devout faith in an ancient god.

31
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,006
<i>Any business with the "tainted"
<i>outside world was forbidden.

32
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,878
<i>That's how it came to be called
<i>"the land of purity."

33
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,483
Amazing.

34
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,385
We must secure this market
no matter what!

35
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,387
They're from the outside world.

36
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,691
They're heretics of the tainted world.

37
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,426
Do not be associated with them.

38
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,530
Outsiders are prohibited

39
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,300
from interacting with our citizens
unless they have permission.

40
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,502
This way, please.

41
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,439
Rejected!

42
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,710
Sasan does not conduct trade
with the outside world.

43
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,478
Please return to your country.

44
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,313
This may sound like a retort...

45
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,884
but we're seeing metal
and mineral resources in Reim

46
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,319
that are imported from Sasan.

47
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,622
I would not call that a trade.

48
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,892
Those materials were supplied
only to honor Sasan's friendship

49
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,294
with the great Reim Empire.

50
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:58,765
The Reim Empire has proven to have
a deep understanding of our strong faith.

51
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,336
Also, Sasan's resources
are all blessings from God.

52
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,806
We'll never let heretics profit off of it.

53
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,809
If you understand,
I ask you to kindly leave.

54
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,343
But...

55
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,546
Then please tell us...

56
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,816
how we can establish
a friendship with Sasan,

57
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,585
not as merchants.

58
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,088
I strive to learn and understand

59
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:26,092
the culture and beliefs
of all countries in the world.

60
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,564
What can I do for your country?

61
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,866
Please, tell me.

62
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:39,005
The people of Sasan welcome each other
and never reject devout followers.

63
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,742
If you have the will
to establish a friendly relationship,

64
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,111
visit the Sasan Knights.

65
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,814
Sasan Knights?

66
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,854
Incredible.

67
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,890
Sasan Knights

68
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,595
are a group of high-ranking churchmen
who control the Sasan church.

69
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,664
An absolute power that leads the nation.

70
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,935
Within the group, the top ranking knight
who protects Sasan

71
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,972
is the Knight-King, Darius Leoxses.

72
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,640
If you get his approval,

73
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,710
Sasan will recognize you as fellows.

74
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,115
Pardon me!

75
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,651
It's very nice to meet you!

76
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,652
Wait!

77
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,121
Be cautious when speaking to the Knights!

78
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,557
If we disrespect them,
they'll kick us out!

79
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,125
Don't worry, leave it to me.

80
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,730
It's a great honor to meet you, sir.
I'm Sinbad,

81
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,866
a merchant coming from the Reim Empire.
I would like...

82
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,168
Insolent fellow! Back off!

83
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,705
I told you!

84
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,808
But we're here
to establish a friendship.

85
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,176
We're not suspicious...

86
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,679
If they fight back, kill them!

87
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:53,980
Wait!

88
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:59,019
Don't taint your spears with the blood
of a man who has no sense of courtesy.

89
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,689
Proceed.

90
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,566
Pardon me!

91
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,536
Please let me join the Knights!

92
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,209
I want to join the Knights.

93
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,612
Look! The Knight-King's heading this way!

94
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,149
Let me greet him at the main entrance.

95
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,717
Why?!

96
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,786
I'm not a suspicious man!

97
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,055
A ruffian! A suspicious man!

98
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,723
Run!

99
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,862
You were given quite the cold shoulder.

100
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:48,535
I underestimated how inflexible
those Knights are.

101
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,472
Of course they are! It's impossible
to have direct conversations with them.

102
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,742
I'm surprised they haven't
kicked us out yet.

103
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,743
Please be aware...

104
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,646
Great! Next time,
I'm determined to talk to them.

105
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:03,550
Using force? Now you're talking.

106
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,051
I'll gladly help.

107
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,088
No! A discussion will do.

108
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,023
We've done nothing wrong.

109
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,125
Were you even listening to me?!

110
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,028
I'm advising you not
to provoke the Knights!

111
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,197
Don't kid around, Hinahoho!

112
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,833
Foreigners are prohibited

113
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,069
from stepping out of their facilities
during the night anyway.

114
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,139
Still, there are barely any customers.

115
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,109
They isolate foreigners

116
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,545
from their citizens
to prevent any kind of contact.

117
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,684
We've yet to succeed in our negotiations
with the Knights. All doors are closed.

118
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,919
Don't be so pessimistic.

119
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,088
Let's negotiate patiently.

120
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,289
Sin.

121
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:44,891
Besides...

122
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,527
their conservative attire
is unfortunate,

123
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,631
but the women of Sasan
have a modest beauty within them.

124
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,933
-Women, eh?
-You're all about them.

125
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,137
Hey there, traveler.

126
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,239
I have a favor to ask.

127
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,075
Will you let me sit next to you?

128
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,812
There are plenty of seats.
You don't need to sit next to me.

129
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,814
No, it's not that!

130
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,784
I just wanted to have a conversation
with you guys!

131
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,018
Hey!

132
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,589
This is a foreigners-only facility!
You're not allowed to enter!

133
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,825
How many times do I have to tell you?!

134
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,795
I know that, but please,
how about a minute?

135
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,998
I won't allow it! Please be more
aware of your position.

136
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,934
You're the Knight-King's son!

137
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,736
The son of the King!

138
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,040
He is the current Knight-King
Darius's son,

139
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,341
Mystras.

140
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,179
If they find out you're here,

141
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,581
I'll suffer the consequences, too!

142
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,716
Please, you must leave at once!

143
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,220
No! We've got strange-looking
foreigners in town!

144
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,256
I won't leave until I hear stories
about the outside world!

145
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,358
What are you saying?

146
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,161
How can you violate the law
while being a Knight?

147
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,630
Don't be so tense, my lady.

148
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,034
He just wants to listen to a few stories.

149
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:05,638
It's a wonderful opportunity
for us to speak with a Knight, too.

150
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,008
Will you let this one pass?

151
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,313
Fine... just for a minute.

152
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,348
Thank you, my lady.

153
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,618
Way to go, Sin.

154
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,121
Please sit back and relax!

155
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,755
Drink up!

156
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,692
Miss! Keep it coming!

157
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,130
How could you eat that much?

158
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:35,768
A Knight lives with fortitude and vigor.
We are only allowed to eat plain food.

159
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,238
I never get to eat such rich...

160
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,774
That was delicious.

161
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,078
So, you wanted to hear our stories?

162
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,347
Why are you so fixated on it?

163
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,783
We, the people of Sasan...

164
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,053
are prohibited by dogma
from stepping out into the world .

165
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,925
The precept is even stricter for me
since I'm a Knight's apprentice.

166
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,693
So, that's why...

167
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,363
I really want to hear
about the outside world!

168
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,802
I'm Sinbad.

169
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:14,040
The head of Sindria Trading Company
and also a Dungeon Capturer.

170
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,241
An adventurer.

171
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,845
A Dungeon Capturer?

172
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,914
This is the book I wrote.

173
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,717
To commemorate this moment,
let me entertain you for a while.

174
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,085
What?

175
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,963
Taking on countless voyages,

176
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,833
there's a man who travels
the world's seas and new lands.

177
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,102
He captures mysterious Dungeons,

178
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,873
and was the first adventurer
to obtain the spirit's almighty power.

179
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,844
I'll now unveil the tales
of Sinbad's adventures!

180
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,917
<i>That was incredible.

181
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,956
<i>It was by far the best I've ever heard.

182
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,026
You wrote this?
We're not that far apart in age...

183
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,861
Amazing.

184
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,864
There's nobody like you...

185
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,866
in this isolated kingdom of Sasan.

186
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,403
Mystras, you don't seem too fond of Sasan.

187
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,873
This country is strictly bounded by dogma.

188
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,877
There's no freedom and the people
are too conservative and serious here.

189
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,981
I'd rather breathe the air
of freedom and die

190
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:33,353
than living in this constricted,
miserable world!

191
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,394
<i>I want to explore the world, too.

192
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,197
<i>There are so many unknowns out there.

193
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,167
<i>And I'm determined to see it
<i>with my very own eyes!

194
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,442
<i>If I ride my horse quickly
<i>to Sinbad's lodging house,

195
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,144
<i>no one will notice.

196
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,147
Where are you headed, Mystras?

197
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,851
Exploring without permission, again?

198
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,453
You snuck out last night as well.

199
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,525
Do not forget,
you're the son of the Knight-King.

200
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,261
Father...

201
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:20,099
I have been aware of your curiosity
about the outside world.

202
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:24,137
But Sasan Knights are forbidden
from leaving their home.

203
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,041
Our dogma is our absolute reality.

204
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,411
Abstain from your reckless actions.

205
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,815
There are quite a few Knights
who are discontent with you.

206
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,383
Besides...

207
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,920
you mustn't act in such a pathetic manner
in front of your brother.

208
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,355
Spartos...

209
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:46,125
I went to your room for a spear lesson...

210
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,262
but wasn't able to find you there.

211
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,264
I'm sorry.

212
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,166
Mystras.

213
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,470
You're at an age
when you'll officially join the Knights.

214
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,508
Rethink your behavior and be
the best role model for your brother.

215
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,477
Do you understand?

216
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,479
No.

217
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,581
I've had enough!

218
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,217
I don't care about the Knights!

219
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,553
I'm sick of this country!

220
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,124
I refuse to live the rest of my life
in these secluded mountains.

221
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,959
I'll never join the Knights!

222
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,938
Brother...

223
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,222
I beg you!

224
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,558
Please, take me with you!

225
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,062
We would love to have you join us...

226
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,532
but we're only here
to establish commerce with Sasan.

227
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,967
So...

228
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,503
Who's there? There's no need to hide.

229
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,042
Spartos, why are you here?

230
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,679
Brother... I respect you very much.

231
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,416
Will you please stay here in Sasan?

232
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,652
The one who's able to succeed father...

233
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,688
as the Knight-King of Sasan

234
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,323
is none other than you.

235
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,060
You should become king.

236
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,629
Didn't you hear me?

237
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,332
I refuse to spend the rest of my life
in this isolated world.

238
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,937
All right, I'll take you with me.

239
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,974
But you can't just leave like this.

240
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,710
You must be responsible
for your own decisions.

241
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,079
Yeah, I know that.

242
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,016
Once a Sasan Knight is baptized,

243
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,085
they must serve Sasan
until the day they die.

244
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:57,423
There's only one way to resign
from the Knights before death.

245
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,058
Brother, that's...

246
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,326
Spartos.

247
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,029
Be sure to tell father...

248
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,233
that I'm officially leaving the Knights.

249
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,081
Hey, there you are.

250
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,323
It's difficult to communicate
with siblings at times.

251
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,394
Fathers are hard to deal with,
in any case.

252
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,065
I'm also a "patriarch's son."

253
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:43,102
I also have a sibling
who cares about me.

254
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,739
It gets overwhelming at times.

255
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,775
Though,
I was in the opposite position as you.

256
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,646
It was a struggle for me
to get out to the outside world.

257
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,583
But in either case...

258
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:02,321
it seems like fathers are authorities
one must eventually overcome.

259
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,261
Is that young man okay?

260
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,396
We'll see.

261
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,665
I'm sure he's fine.

262
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:17,803
Hey.

263
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,506
What are you doing here...

264
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,441
Yunan?

265
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,177
Sinbad...

266
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,613
you've aged.

267
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,183
I did not!
I only grew and got bigger!

268
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,052
I'm a handsome man now!

269
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,254
You sure about that?

270
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,323
Sin, who's this?

271
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:42,261
He's the traveler who led me
to Baal's dungeon two years ago.

272
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,830
But I don't know who he actually is.

273
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,365
You don't?!

274
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:50,703
Well, that's a bummer.
I've been watching you all this time.

275
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,639
You obtained a second Djinn, right?

276
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:57,410
How do you know about that?
You sure are a strange one.

277
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,179
So, what brings you here this time?

278
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,515
I'm sure you already know.

279
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:07,186
Recently, Dungeons have been
popping up all around the world.

280
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,489
Yeah, ever since I captured Baal,

281
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,092
there's been sightings all around.

282
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,828
Yes... and now, the royalty

283
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,365
and people of power
are challenging dungeons

284
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,268
and obtaining the Djinns' powers.

285
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,670
There are Capturers in the great
Reim Empire,

286
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,874
the Kou Empire, a new power that achieved
the unification of three nations,

287
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,777
the small countries of Artemyra
and Heliohapt,

288
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,682
even your homeland, Parthevia.

289
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,786
And finally, here in Sasan.

290
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,890
You're not the only Capturer
who holds the power of the Djinn anymore.

291
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,327
So... there's a Capturer
in this country too?

292
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,631
Yup, the most powerful man
of this country.

293
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,766
The Knight-King, Darius Leoxses.

294
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:58,771
How are you going to face these Capturers,

295
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,373
Sinbad?

296
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,310
I'm only here to discuss business.

297
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,444
I see.

298
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:09,682
Our original intention
was to speak with the Knight-King

299
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,585
to establish commerce with Sasan.

300
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:17,189
It doesn't matter if the Knight-King
is a Capturer or not.

301
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,326
But now you got me really excited.

302
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,697
You're as amusing as ever!

303
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,733
I can't wait to see what happens...

304
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,770
when Capturers come face to face.

305
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,572
Until next time, Sinbad.

306
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,307
He disappeared!

307
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,177
Sin! That man just disappeared!

308
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,223
Victor, Mystras!

309
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,460
Impressive, he's taking all of them down.

310
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,629
Was he always that strong?

311
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,465
The Knight-King is the only one left.

312
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,835
Now it's your turn, father!

313
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,438
If I win, I'm free!

314
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,274
That young man is serious.

315
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,945
According to the gatekeepers,
the one defeated loses his head.

316
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,680
Yeah...

317
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:17,416
Apprentice Knight, Mystras Leoxses.

318
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,686
Knight-King, Darius Leoxses.

319
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:25,291
Here now under God's dogma,
a fair match commences!

320
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,859
Begin!

321
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:36,869
<i>Father! How's the spear technique
<i>you hammered into me?

322
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,605
<i>I've only polished my skills...

323
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,708
<i>and dreamed of this day, to defeat you!

324
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,643
Almost!

325
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,812
He's quite skilled.

326
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,318
It seems like you do have the skills
to boast about.

327
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,754
But attacks at this level...

328
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,555
Shut it!

329
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,924
Strike back, Alloces!

330
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:13,005
That's the power of God
only accessible to the Knight-King.

331
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,376
The legendary tower that only appears
when the world experiences abnormality.

332
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,580
The Knight-King captured
and obtained its power.

333
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,317
<i>This... is God's...

334
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:29,388
<i>I've never encountered it before.

335
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,624
<i>But why do I recognize this power?

336
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,061
<i>Shoot... so this is the power of God?

337
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,365
<i>Then... this is sink or swim!

338
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,767
Weak!

339
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,940
<i>My true target... is over here!

340
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,981
Didn't I tell you?

341
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,818
I'll shoot this power back at you.

342
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,628
Is that all you've got?

343
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,633
Here's a tribute to you.

344
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,702
Knight Mystras!

345
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,437
Brother!

346
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,006
I praise your brave fight!

347
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,710
Hold it right there!
