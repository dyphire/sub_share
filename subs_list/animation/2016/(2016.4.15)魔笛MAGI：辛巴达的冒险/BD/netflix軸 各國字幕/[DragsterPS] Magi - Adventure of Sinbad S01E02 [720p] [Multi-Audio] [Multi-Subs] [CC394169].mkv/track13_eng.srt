1
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,082
The only way left for us

2
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,184
is to capture this Dungeon.

3
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,486
Seize its power

4
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:23,123
and end the war against our old enemy,
Reim Empire.

5
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,559
Sacrifice your life for your country.

6
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,763
That's our honor
as Parthevian military men.

7
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,641
<i>Its existence was first confirmed

8
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,610
<i>in a strait between two great powers
<i>lying in the southwest.

9
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,480
<i>Before long, it was called the Dungeon.

10
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,515
<i>This mysterious building

11
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:53,487
<i>became a target for capture
<i>by both Parthevia and Reim.

12
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:59,092
<i>Over ten thousand people were sent there,
<i>but no one came back.

13
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,130
<i>Until one boy took on the challenge.

14
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,275
We can't do it.

15
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,311
We won't survive this storm.

16
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,546
We're all going to die.

17
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,248
Don't be afraid of the waves.

18
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,225
Read the flow of the waves, accept them,

19
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,195
and overcome them.

20
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,699
It's Contastia.

21
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,301
It's a big city.

22
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,703
It's very lively.

23
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,872
It's a remote region.

24
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,308
The government doesn't have
full control here,

25
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,911
in both good and bad ways.

26
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,680
Let's sell our stuff quickly and go home.

27
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,922
If you don't want to die
leave your stuff here and go.

28
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,891
Somebody!

29
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,794
Another gang of robbers
who escaped the military service.

30
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,764
Visiting this town without a guard?

31
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,899
They're the perfect prey.

32
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,838
Boss, there are only women and kids
in here.

33
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,507
Good timing. Let's get these women, too.

34
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,844
We'll take good care of you.

35
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,878
What about this one?

36
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,451
Stop.

37
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,958
It's only a kid.

38
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,862
Go home and take a leak or something.

39
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:30,637
Humans and oceans, both are like waves.

40
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,375
There's no wave

41
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,046
-that I can't overcome.
-Darn it.

42
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,869
Damn kid.

43
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,723
Thank you so much.

44
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,659
You're strong.

45
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,429
I simply read their waves.

46
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,599
How can we thank you?

47
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,434
It's not necessary.

48
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,104
Are you transporting goods
without male company?

49
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,439
Yes.

50
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,475
Our father and brothers went to the war.

51
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,644
It's the same in the neighboring town.

52
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,415
They got away from military duty,

53
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,051
but must've become thieves to survive.

54
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,921
I know. Why don't you hire me?

55
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:55,855
What?

56
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,893
Fishing is limited now
and I don't have a job.

57
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,528
Besides...

58
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,000
pretty girls like you

59
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,469
shouldn't be exposed to danger.

60
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,975
We're going home by the sea route,
so we don't need a guard.

61
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,610
Okay. Too bad.

62
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,981
Why don't you take some of our goods?

63
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,882
They're all fresh fruits.

64
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,817
Are you sure?

65
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,153
The ones in this barrel

66
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,055
are the best of the crop.

67
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,068
Don't open without permission.

68
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,410
I'm Yunan. A traveler.

69
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,779
Thank you for earlier.

70
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,181
Why were you in there?

71
00:06:55,915 --> 00:07:00,754
It's dark, narrow
and comfortable in a barrel.

72
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,788
<i>He's weird.

73
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,557
Are you sure it's okay

74
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,660
for me to stay at your house?

75
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,596
It's natural to help someone in trouble.

76
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,999
There. I can see it now.

77
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,702
That's Tison village, where I live.

78
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,542
Oh, Sinbad is here.

79
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,444
Welcome back, Sinbad.

80
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,146
Did you get a job at the port?

81
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,983
I didn't get a job, but instead, here.

82
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,720
-Eat it.
-Thank you.

83
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,824
Wow, it's rare to see such fresh fruits.

84
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,161
Don't worry about us
and take them to your mom.

85
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,163
It's okay.

86
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,198
I have more for my mom

87
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,168
and exchanged some for
medicinal herbs, too.

88
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,770
You're a good boy.

89
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,499
You're trusted well here.

90
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,633
Am I?

91
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,206
Come on in.

92
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,678
It's a dark, narrow
and comfortable looking house.

93
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,080
Do you have a guest?

94
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,016
Welcome.

95
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,651
Mom, it's okay.

96
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,587
Stay in bed.

97
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,623
-But...
-It's okay. Here.

98
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:53,967
Coming all this way to a remote region
like this to police military escapees?

99
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,536
Parthevia is in decline.

100
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,971
Yeah.

101
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,941
Our commander wouldn't
usually come here either.

102
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,912
Stop chatting

103
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,248
if you want to stay alive.

104
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,716
Yes, sir.

105
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,850
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,155
Really, our commander has
such a short temper.

107
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:21,227
That's exactly what's expected of
our commander, Dragul.

108
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,243
Good morning. What a nice day, Sinbad.

109
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,244
Good morning, Yunan.

110
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,615
Oh, you're early. Are you leaving now?

111
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,619
Yeah. I work in the morning
carrying cargo at the port.

112
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,825
Here. Eat this if you feel up to it.

113
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,828
Wow. Thank you.

114
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,763
It's hot.

115
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,199
It's delicious.

116
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,200
What are you going to do?

117
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,137
I'll make a tour of the village
and continue on my journey.

118
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,907
Okay.

119
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,911
You can come and go as you please.
See you.

120
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,750
Do you like it?

121
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,822
Good morning.
Thank you for letting me stay here.

122
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,790
It's been a big help.

123
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,358
You're welcome.

124
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,867
Thank you.

125
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,971
I shouldn't make my guest worry about me.

126
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,240
Have you been ill for a while?

127
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:41,774
Yes.

128
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,744
I'm putting a burden on him.

129
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,248
He's a kind boy.

130
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,984
He's just like his dad.

131
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,254
My husband used to say

132
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,690
that "Sinbad has a special power."

133
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,696
Dad.

134
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:05,965
Not this way.

135
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:07,901
That way.

136
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,281
But because of me,
he's had to stay in this village.

137
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,051
I worry about that a lot.

138
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,122
I'm sorry to tell you stuff like this.

139
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,257
I don't know why.

140
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:35,094
You make me feel as though
I can share anything with you.

141
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,029
Really?

142
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,364
So, Yunan.

143
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,333
I have a favor to ask you.

144
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,102
If anything happens to Sin...

145
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:47,740
please guide him.

146
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,812
Because...

147
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:57,216
as a traveler you have more experience
than I do, right?

148
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,486
I could complicate things for him
even more by getting involved.

149
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,191
I'll be happy to.

150
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,295
Terrible news.

151
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,134
Listen, Esra.

152
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,903
Sinbad is...

153
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:29,148
I'm Dragul, the commander of
the Western Region military unit.

154
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:33,753
Draft papers have been sent to you
many times from the military.

155
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,888
Present yourself within three days.

156
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,191
What if I refuse?

157
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,998
You don't have the right to refuse.

158
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,166
This is an order from the military.

159
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,936
Why are they being so harsh?

160
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,940
Sin has been ignoring
the draft notice, but they finally...

161
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,975
What are you doing to Sinbad?

162
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,043
Shut it.

163
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,017
Calm down.
Just wait five more years or so,

164
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,021
you'll be of service to the country
as a soldier.

165
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,159
Hey, wait.

166
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,895
Be of service?

167
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,165
Who do you think we are?

168
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,534
Just as I said.

169
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,570
It's normal for people
to serve their country.

170
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,006
<i>You citizens are

171
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,977
<i>an important workforce
<i>for the war against Reim Empire.

172
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,580
We're not a tool for war.

173
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,151
My dad was sent to war
and never came back.

174
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,120
So were all the other men
in this village.

175
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,590
I'll never join the military.

176
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,961
Exactly. Sin is right.

177
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,465
The war only makes us suffer.

178
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,533
Stop fooling us.

179
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,401
What's up with these guys?

180
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,437
Commander Dragul.

181
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,178
Sinbad, you have a mother, right?

182
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,948
Rejecting military duty is a major crime.

183
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,051
Remember that
your mother will be guilty, too.

184
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,556
You guys all know about that Dungeon,
don't you?

185
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,591
The magicians of this country say

186
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,428
there's a power in there
that's beyond human knowledge.

187
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:28,334
We have to obtain that power
no matter what.

188
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,204
That's an order from the king,

189
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,074
and it will serve
this nation and its people.

190
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,311
Sinbad, in the end, your father too,

191
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,180
went to war for this nation, didn't he?

192
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,250
Remember that.

193
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:46,919
Brother!

194
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,326
Don't go, Sinbad.

195
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,601
Going to the military now means

196
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,504
going to the Dungeon.

197
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,242
Over ten thousand people were sent there,
but no one came back.

198
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,145
It's called the hole of death.

199
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,516
I can't die yet.

200
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,920
<i>For my mom
<i>and for everyone else in the village.

201
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,323
Can't you get out of the draft?

202
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,025
You saw it, didn't you?

203
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:30,029
Refusing the draft will result in
a death sentence or forced labor.

204
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,331
We can't defy military orders.

205
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,335
If I get drafted I'll die.
If I refuse the draft I'll die, too.

206
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,137
The war never ends.

207
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,375
This country has gone to the dumps.
It's finished.

208
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:46,078
Then you should go to the tower.

209
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,483
I told you, ten thousand people
were sent there and no one--

210
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,953
You said this country is finished.

211
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,089
Then you should become king.

212
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,627
Change this country and the world
with your own hands.

213
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,096
You're kidding, right?

214
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:10,703
"Humans and oceans, both are like waves.
There's no wave that I can't overcome."

215
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,306
Right?

216
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,477
Accept your fate and overcome it.

217
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,011
You know what to do.

218
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,982
Go to the tower.

219
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,251
There's something there that you want.

220
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,719
The power of a king.

221
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,388
The power of a king?

222
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,558
Yunan.

223
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,127
Who exactly are you?

224
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,664
I'm...

225
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,034
just a traveler.

226
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:51,177
<i>If such a power really exists...

227
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,246
<i>I'll seize it.

228
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,415
<i>I can change the world

229
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,751
<i>from its current state.

230
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,463
Mom, I'm...

231
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,333
-Yes.
-Ah... Well...

232
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,704
No. Nothing.

233
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,606
Sinbad.

234
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,476
Come over here.

235
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,389
The Dungeon Capturing Unit, 100 soldiers.

236
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,624
They're ready to be deployed.

237
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:42,328
Yes. His majesty is counting on you.

238
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,831
Go fulfill your duty.

239
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,266
Yes, sir.

240
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,103
A thousand soldiers
that went ahead have been destroyed.

241
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,073
Now we're sending a troop
of a mishmash of 100 soldiers.

242
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,678
Meaning that if there's a casualty
from the noble Dragul family,

243
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,814
it would be easier to control
the citizens' discontent.

244
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,651
However noble,
I'm the youngest of the lot.

245
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:11,290
My older brothers wouldn't have been given
this kind of duty.

246
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,828
Such things shouldn't be said carelessly
inside the palace, Dragul.

247
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,663
Miss Serendine.

248
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,666
Long time no see.
But that name is too long.

249
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,868
Call me Seren.

250
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,304
But I couldn't.

251
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,808
You're always so formal.

252
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,511
When you were little
you used to follow me like a baby duck.

253
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,614
You were like a little brother to me.

254
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,584
It's okay.

255
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,288
This capture of the Dungeon...

256
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,491
Is it true that you're commanding it?

257
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,692
Yes.

258
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,195
I see.

259
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,433
Miss Serendine, you've treated me

260
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,404
like family since I was little.

261
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,808
I will succeed in capturing the Dungeon.

262
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,313
I won't disgrace your name,
Miss Serendine.

263
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,323
Are you done with the roll call?

264
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,893
Yes, but there's one who didn't show up.

265
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,596
Sinbad of Tison village is not here.

266
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,730
Sinbad?

267
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,434
That one. It's fine.

268
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,737
It's no big deal
being short of a kid or two.

269
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,307
-Kid? You're a kid, too, aren't you?
-You!

270
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,776
Listen up.

271
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,944
I'm going to seize
the power of the Dungeon.

272
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,714
I'll never let you take it.

273
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,451
Not you guys that do nothing
but torture this country...

274
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,319
Not ever!

275
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,190
Yunan.

276
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,726
There it is, Sinbad.

277
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,229
That's the entrance to the Dungeon,
the Holy Gate.

278
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,765
Once you enter it

279
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,202
you won't be able to come back
unless you capture the Dungeon.

280
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,804
Are you ready?

281
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,339
Yeah. I've already made up my mind.

282
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,276
I'll return with the power.

283
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,713
<i>No matter what.

284
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,882
<i>Sinbad, come over here.

285
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,321
Take this with you.

286
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,357
That's Dad's keepsake.

287
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,795
Sin,
don't hold yourself back because of me.

288
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,667
I've been putting a burden on you.

289
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:39,972
But you've found your calling,
haven't you?

290
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:44,276
Do what you have to do.

291
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,712
Your dad would want that, too.

292
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,718
I'm going to be okay.
Other people will help me now.

293
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,387
So, you go ahead.

294
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,670
Thank you, Mom.

295
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,406
Yunan.

296
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:15,841
See you again.

297
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,346
<i>Sinbad,

298
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:24,416
<i>you're a miracle child who has
<i>the great ability to change the world.

299
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,920
<i>Once you obtain the power of the Dungeon,

300
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,322
<i>what will you become?

301
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,994
<i>I'm looking forward to it,
<i>but also afraid of it.

302
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,864
Go forth, Sinbad.

303
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,667
All troops, go forward!

304
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,510
Where is this?

305
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:53,813
Light?

306
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,387
<i>What... is that?

307
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,490
<i>It feels as though I can reach it.

308
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,332
This is...

309
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,651
This is the Dungeon.
