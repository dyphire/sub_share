1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,883
It's a great pleasure to meet you.

2
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,636
My name is Ja'far, a merchant.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,095
It would be an honor

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,765
if you could stock our products
at your lovely store.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,017
What the heck am I saying?

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,686
I've had enough, old hag!

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,189
Old hag?

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,358
Rurumu Chop!

9
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,363
How many times do I have to remind you?

10
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,906
When you address a mature lady

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,825
call them "Miss" or "Madam."

12
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,162
We're part of Imuchakk's

13
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,623
official merchant ship crew led by Sinbad.

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,668
Our every conduct will help build

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,128
a strong, reliable relationship.

16
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,880
You tell them!

17
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,342
My wife's the best teacher for them.

18
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,846
But if you're completely illiterate,
forget about it!

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,809
You must learn general education,
culture, geography

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,435
and of course, mathematics!

21
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,272
Ja'far! Correct your posture!

22
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,690
You're staggering!

23
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,444
Hanging in there guys?

24
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,407
Chief! No. Mr. Ja'far, you got this!

25
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,535
My brain's about to explode...

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,245
Everyone!

27
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,997
It's lunch time!

28
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,376
Don't you forget about table manners.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,837
<i>Don't make a sound.

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,922
<i>Or else we get the Chop!

31
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,220
<i>Delicious!

32
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,598
Good, huh? I can count on Rurumu
for everything.

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,268
She's the most talented woman of Imuchakk.

34
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,979
<i>My stomach is telling me

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,399
<i>to never disobey this woman!

36
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,237
Ja'far changed quite a bit,
don't you think?

37
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,532
Never knew he could smile like that.

38
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,410
We owe it all to you guys.

39
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,705
What do you think?

40
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,707
Time for a celebratory drink?

41
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,209
Rurumu will be pissed if she found out.

42
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,170
-Come on, don't jinx it.
-Hey!

43
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,381
Sit properly! Watch your manners.

44
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,052
Your expression, the lines
between your brows!

45
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,054
You'll scare everyone away!

46
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,847
No! My eyes!

47
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,434
You still have a long way to go!

48
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,854
Let's get back to work, shall we?

49
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,164
A monstrous ship is about to arrive.

50
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,624
Never seen anything like it!

51
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,752
Rumor says it's a ship
from the remote North!

52
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,925
-It's high!
-It's scary!

53
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,098
We're here.

54
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,016
The Reim Empire!

55
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:18,949
Amazing!

56
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,673
<i>The Reim Empire is a powerful nation
<i>with the world's largest territory.

57
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:03,428
<i>Napolia was the most populated business
<i>municipal next to Remano, the capital.

58
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:07,682
<i>The scale of its economy surpasses
<i>even the great maritime nation, Balbadd.

59
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,394
<i>The city is a leading financial center
<i>of the world's economy.

60
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,943
<i>The world is full of unfamiliar things!

61
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,990
We've finally reached Reim.

62
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,829
No time to waste! Let's get to business!

63
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,998
Come and see for yourself!

64
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,836
Direct imports from Imuchakk!

65
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,712
Don't miss out on these goods!

66
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,090
What's on offer? Imuchakk?

67
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,925
-Let's see.
-The savage tribe of the North?

68
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,927
Very unique craftsmanship.

69
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,345
Are they genuine?

70
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,596
Of course!

71
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,101
We're the only ones approved to sell
Imuchakk goods!

72
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,562
Here's our contract
if you'd like to read it.

73
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,522
I see.

74
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,691
Please do not be concerned.

75
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,026
I promise that I would never
put you at a loss.

76
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,279
Lovely lady.

77
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,950
-I would like to purchase this.
-I want this!

78
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,577
Thanks for your business!

79
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,995
Oh dear!

80
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,664
Sin's got chops.

81
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,250
At least it won't be considered fraud.

82
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,711
Hey!

83
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,964
Who's approval do you have
to set up shop here?

84
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,382
Oh, I apologize.

85
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,135
We'll start the procedure at once.

86
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,970
Where do I need to go?

87
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,848
A merchant who doesn't know
how to sell in Reim?

88
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,560
All commercial transactions have to
go through the Reim Merchant Union.

89
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,020
They manage and control everything.

90
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,439
Only companies approved by the union

91
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,316
are allowed to do business here.

92
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,776
If you understand, leave at once!

93
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,112
That includes all of you too!
Scram!

94
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,865
So that's how it works.

95
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,825
Since I studied from old books

96
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,243
I had no idea.

97
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,120
Who's the proprietor here?

98
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,288
That would be me.

99
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,248
How can I help you?

100
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,627
Will you be willing to sell me
everything you have?

101
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,211
What?

102
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,796
But it's against the law right now.

103
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,798
Indeed.

104
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:08,053
Non-union members are
prohibited to sell to the general public.

105
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,181
But since I'm affiliated with the union

106
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,559
I'm able to purchase goods from you.

107
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,810
I see.

108
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,481
You came all this way to Reim.

109
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,068
You wouldn't want to return
with a full inventory.

110
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,819
That's right.

111
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,113
In that case...

112
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,282
Please let us do business with you!

113
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,201
This is the written oath.

114
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,246
Wait here. I'll go get the men
who'll transport the goods.

115
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,748
Thank you very much.

116
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,708
What a relief!

117
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,879
We wouldn't want to risk dead stock.

118
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,798
As merchants,

119
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,217
that was an ideal transaction.

120
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,843
Sure was!

121
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,389
Amazing.

122
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,848
Please accept it.

123
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,183
This much?

124
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,853
I hope to do business with you again.

125
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,445
We hit the jack pot!

126
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,656
-A huge success!
-Yeah.

127
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,241
It would've been embarrassing

128
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,451
taking all those goods back home.

129
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,336
What's going on?

130
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,840
These are our products.

131
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,426
The prices are five times

132
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,637
no, ten times higher!

133
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:33,972
We've been deceived.

134
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,266
He took advantage of us.

135
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,978
That guy makes his money by reselling.

136
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,525
He must target non-union merchants...

137
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,986
just like us.

138
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:53,908
I see.

139
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,660
It's unfair.

140
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,788
What was our total loss?

141
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,331
I don't know.

142
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,375
But in the end,

143
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,377
we need to join the union

144
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,754
to do business in Reim.

145
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,424
We can't argue about the resale.

146
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,009
You're right.

147
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,802
I underestimated how business works.

148
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,554
It's true.

149
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,015
This is the reality of business.

150
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,435
We're still total amateurs at this.

151
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,145
What are you saying?

152
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,356
That's the fun of it!

153
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,984
But we were just deceived!

154
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,402
Don't you get it?

155
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,321
That's why it's fun.

156
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,075
I respect merchants.

157
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,746
Don't you think they're
the shrewdest of them all?

158
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,499
The world revolves around money.

159
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,709
Money is moved by merchants.

160
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,420
Merchants stand
in the forefront of the world.

161
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,091
They have a great grasp on society
which helps them make astute forecasts.

162
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,761
It wouldn't be an exaggeration if I said
that merchants move the world.

163
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,181
We get to compete
with people of that caliber!

164
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,600
It's nothing short of mind-blowing!

165
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,229
Jeez, you got me again.

166
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,397
If our leader says so,

167
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,858
it's our duty to follow him.

168
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,405
Sinbad, are you sure about this?

169
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,365
Yup.

170
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,951
Head back to Imuchakk at once

171
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,869
and return with new goods.

172
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,332
By the time you return,
I hope to settle things with the union.

173
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,834
Got it.

174
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,377
We're counting on you.

175
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,262
<i>I have so much more to learn

176
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:38,972
<i>about the world,

177
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,473
<i>this country,

178
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,225
<i>its people,

179
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,061
<i>and business and trade.

180
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,898
<i>I can't waste time and fall behind

181
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,652
<i>because I'm gonna be king!

182
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,408
Gotta take care of my stomach first.

183
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,122
<i>This is all I've got.

184
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,708
<i>I gave all the profits to Hinahoho

185
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,003
<i>and the crew to purchase more goods.

186
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,589
<i>Let's see what I can do with this.

187
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,481
What's the matter?

188
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,650
Doesn't this belong to you?

189
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,114
Would you like to join me for dinner?

190
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,495
My name is Harun.

191
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,290
I'm a trader from Balbadd.

192
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,625
Balbadd?

193
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,045
That's the largest economy next to Reim.

194
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,215
If you're a merchant, it's worth a visit.

195
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,551
-It's a very active city.
-Yes.

196
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,511
I'll look you up when I'm in town.

197
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,890
You do know, right?

198
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,809
I'm selling your goods at a higher price.

199
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,227
Yes.

200
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,814
That was due to
our lack of knowledge and experience.

201
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,399
In other words

202
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,779
I lost the trade battle with you, Harun.

203
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,410
So that's why you approached me
to learn about the ins and outs?

204
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,829
Indeed, that's correct.

205
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,999
Your composed greed

206
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,335
tells me you're fit to be a merchant.

207
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,545
So I shall teach you.

208
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,093
Reim has never seen goods
from Imuchakk before.

209
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,429
You had the most lucrative product

210
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,808
but missed the timing to sell
at the highest price

211
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,687
and let another merchant decide
on its standard market value.

212
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,772
Think of this incident

213
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,526
as the greatest loss you can ever imagine.

214
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,822
<i>Something about this man

215
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,490
<i>tells me he's more than a merchant.

216
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,243
So will you tell me

217
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,163
how you got the great man Rametoto
to approve of this?

218
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,289
<i>I knew it.

219
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,877
I've been curious ever since you made
your grand entrance at the port.

220
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,923
I've been to Imuchakk many times
to ask for approval

221
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,801
but was always turned down.

222
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:26,139
So why did they allow an inexperienced boy
to handle their goods?

223
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,933
<i>Please do not forget

224
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,645
<i>that manners and words greatly influence
<i>face-to-face negotiations.

225
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,148
<i>But most importantly...

226
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,984
No matter how ignorant I may be

227
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,070
I can't reveal my business secrets.

228
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,908
<i>Smile.

229
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,494
<i>Even if you're facing an enemy,

230
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,914
<i>people can't attack others with a smile.

231
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,628
I need to acquire a deeper understanding
of this country.

232
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,797
In exchange for that,

233
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,341
I'll reveal everything to you.

234
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,637
Yes, only if we can be comrades

235
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,890
who support and share
each other's knowledge.

236
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,188
You're telling me to become your comrade?

237
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,150
A comrade with a child like you?

238
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,153
You're selling me short on that one.

239
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,159
But, I'll give you an ear.

240
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,120
Please.

241
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,214
The wine... froze?!

242
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,259
That's the power of the ice Djinn,
Valefor.

243
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,679
It's an ability only Dungeon Capturers
can acquire.

244
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,849
You're a Dungeon Capturer?!

245
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,684
Yes.

246
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,231
I'm intensely curious about your story.

247
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:03,444
A battle facing a great dragon
and a treasure vault of a historic ruin.

248
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,865
Your stories are more interesting
than a court poet's!

249
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,242
Court poet?

250
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,036
Taking on adventures

251
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,622
and exploring this vast world.

252
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,751
You're living a dream, I'm in awe.

253
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,046
But I still can't figure out

254
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,759
what you're going to do
with the powers you obtained.

255
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,764
I'm going
to revolutionize this world.

256
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,766
Revolutionize?

257
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,561
My home country, Parthevia

258
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,857
exploits their citizens and is headed
to self-destruction.

259
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,234
I have a strong desire to save the people.

260
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,196
But it can't be done by myself.

261
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,116
I knew I needed to obtain greater power.

262
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,661
I need to create a country
that moves the world.

263
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,914
I'm going to become king.

264
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,750
King?!

265
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,671
Sure, a king may have power,
but it's more of a burden.

266
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,967
It's impossible to cater to the needs
of the world and people...

267
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,264
Sinbad.

268
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,808
Your story is intriguing

269
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,561
but still immature.

270
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:23,232
In order to join Reim's merchant union

271
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,943
you need a recommendation letter
from a union merchant

272
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:29,363
and 1000 gold coins
as an admission fee.

273
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,367
It's out of reach
for most commoners.

274
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,078
But if your motivations are genuine,

275
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,624
and you truly want
to revolutionize this world,

276
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,251
make it happen.

277
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,379
I'm heading to Remano tomorrow
for business.

278
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,507
I'll be back in a month.

279
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,342
Prove yourself by raising

280
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,136
1000 gold coins by then.

281
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,180
Depending on the outcome,

282
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,683
I'll write you a recommendation letter
to the union.

283
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,939
<i>This is it!

284
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,398
<i>This is the flow.

285
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,401
<i>I'll make it happen!

286
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:15,284
I certainly never thought you would make
negotiations with a civilian child.

287
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,580
Do you see something in that boy?

288
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,208
It was just on a whim.

289
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,255
It's like watering a flower in the street.

290
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,464
Besides...

291
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,219
it's just a child's dream.

292
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,013
I'm sure he'll be crushed by reality
in a month

293
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,182
and give it all up.

294
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,647
<i>I wonder...

295
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,650
<i>what Harun's true identity is?

296
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,611
Please stay at our room upstairs.

297
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,615
The guest with you paid for the full stay.

298
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,953
<i>I've come this far,
<i>I can't miss out on this chance.

299
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:03,082
<i>But what can I do
<i>to raise 1000 gold coins?

300
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,086
<i>I have to join the union by the time

301
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,671
<i>Hinahoho and the crew gets back.

302
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,881
<i>I can't waste any time.

303
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,594
<i>Even if I work as a boatman
<i>or a carriage guard

304
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,554
<i>I'll only make three bronze coins a day.

305
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:21,058
<i>On top of that,
<i>even if I work as a dishwasher

306
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,519
<i>I wouldn't be able to raise that much
<i>in a month.

307
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,814
<i>A thousand gold coins?

308
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,026
<i>That's nothing
<i>when it comes to founding a nation.

309
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,819
<i>So think.

310
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,614
<i>What can I do?

311
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,367
Oh.

312
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,373
<i>I was able to capture Baal and Valefor

313
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,293
<i>because I had this.

314
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,382
I got it.

315
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:58,262
ONE MONTH LATER

316
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,432
We've arrived in Napolia.

317
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,935
Hurry or else you'll miss it!

318
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,688
I heard that it's amazing! I'm excited!

319
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,982
What festivity could it be?

320
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,275
-Hurry!
-Wait up!

321
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,654
Wow.

322
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,325
This is a story about a boy.

323
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,541
The Dungeon!

324
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,629
<i>Thousands of people took on the challenge

325
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,090
<i>but never returned.

326
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,218
<i>When one gets past the sacred gate

327
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,512
<i>they see the ancient city

328
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,098
<i>that was destroyed ages ago.

329
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,146
While killing off small dragons

330
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,273
<i>the boy proceeds further.

331
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,484
<i>He faces a great dragon

332
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,028
<i>that shoots out lightning.

333
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,989
<i>The boy fought with all his might.

334
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,908
<i>And just as the dragon's fire breath

335
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,368
<i>was about to hit the boy,

336
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,664
<i>he pierced the dragon with his sword!

337
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,626
Yes.

338
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,128
That boy...

339
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,511
is me, Sinbad!

340
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,683
Amazing! He's a real Capturer!

341
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,686
That's the power of the spirit?

342
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,522
Dungeons really exist!

343
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,408
Harun!

344
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,034
I'm impressed.

345
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,662
This is like an amphitheater.

346
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,330
Yes, fortunately.

347
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,207
Sinbad!

348
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,667
Indeed.

349
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,212
This is something only you,
a Capturer can do.

350
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,964
What a brilliant idea.

351
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,968
It's all because of you, Harun.

352
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,095
You were the one who said that

353
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,973
my stories were more entertaining
than a court poet's.

354
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,684
You even said I was living a dream and
you were in awe.

355
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,061
That made me realize

356
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,647
that adventure stories can captivate

357
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,232
and excite anybody.

358
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,152
I was once captivated
as child myself, too.

359
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,782
But I'm still very far
from a thousand gold coins.

360
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,785
And today's the promised day.

361
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,706
Will you please give me more time?

362
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,250
I will fulfill my terms no matter what!

363
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,419
I won't give up.

364
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,054
This is my listening fee to you.

365
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,723
Accept this, Sinbad.

366
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,475
As your comrade,

367
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,646
I'll support your dream.

368
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,856
So, our promise...

369
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,109
You have a lot coming ahead of you,
my friend.

370
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,656
There's no time for you to waste.

371
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,075
Harun.

372
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:07,618
No, Mentor!

373
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,203
Who are you?

374
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,747
Oh, there you are.

375
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,124
Please give us notice before you go out.

376
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,714
He's the 22nd King of Balbadd.

377
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,759
His excellency, King Rashid!
