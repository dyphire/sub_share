1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,783
<i>I've never encountered it before.

2
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,453
<i>But why do I recognize this power?

3
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,690
<i>This is sink or swim!

4
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:25,759
Weak!

5
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,329
<i>My true target

6
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,198
<i>is over here!

7
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,071
Didn't I tell you?

8
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,475
I'll shoot this power back at you.

9
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,082
Here's a tribute to you.

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,318
Knight Mystras!

11
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,419
Brother!

12
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,255
I praise your brave fight!

13
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,792
Hold it right there!

14
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,340
Who are you?!

15
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,643
-Capture him!
-Wait!

16
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,825
This is a sacred battle
based on the dogma.

17
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,628
I ask you to stay out of it.

18
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,597
A scared battle, huh?

19
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:22,569
So that's the power of God you
obtained by capturing the Dungeon?

20
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,407
You did gain that power by victory,

21
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,276
so you're free to use it your way.

22
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,280
But that power isn't God's grace.

23
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,615
It's a power given to all those

24
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,218
who capture a Dungeon.

25
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,754
In other words, that power

26
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,391
has nothing to do with the dogma followed
by the people of Sasan.

27
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,894
-State who you are.
-I'm Sinbad.

28
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,798
A merchant who travels the world

29
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,335
and a Capturer, just like you.

30
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,739
I challenge you to a battle.

31
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,308
As you can tell, I have a loose tongue.

32
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,710
So I could blab about anything.

33
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,714
If you win, you can punish me
anyway you want.

34
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,649
And if you win?

35
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,251
I'll take him with me.

36
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,789
Of course,

37
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,859
you'll let us do business with you
as well.

38
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,595
Battling the Knight-King?!

39
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,331
Does he know what he's getting into?

40
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,666
Arrest that ruffian!

41
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:30,570
But the power we just saw
was unmistakably the power of God.

42
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:34,441
The Knight-King
wasn't the only one with it?

43
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,876
Of course.

44
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,711
I finally understand, Sin.

45
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,913
The people of this country

46
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,014
is bound by the dogma

47
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,651
and believes that the Knight-King is the
only one who can handle the Djinn.

48
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,454
But that's an illusion.

49
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,923
-So?
-The suspicion towards

50
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,327
the Knight-King would lead people
to question the dogma itself.

51
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,595
I see.

52
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,399
He's going straight for the weak spot.

53
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,602
So, what are you gonna do?

54
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,671
Will you accept this challenge?

55
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,874
What a shameless, vulgar man.

56
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,645
Even more so as a merchant of
the outside world.

57
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,649
He's only an apprentice Knight
defeated in duel.

58
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,318
I don't care what happens to him.

59
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,456
But I cannot silently overlook
anything related to national affairs.

60
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,627
I accept this challenge!

61
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,664
Don't, Sinbad!

62
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,334
You won't be able to defeat my father.

63
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,970
-Mystras?
-No attacks

64
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,507
can get through his power.
His surroundings

65
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,809
are protected by an impregnable barrier.

66
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,645
The stronger the attack,

67
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,481
he strikes back with a force even greater!

68
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,484
Careless attacks would put us in danger!

69
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,588
Sinbad...

70
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,057
He's unstoppable.

71
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,625
But at this rate...

72
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,629
Sin's purposely provoking him
with that attitude.

73
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,832
He's got his own agenda.

74
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,136
Let's believe our leader.

75
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,976
Mere child's play.

76
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,847
Let's see how you'll do with me!

77
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,388
You're definitely qualified
to call yourself a Knight-King.

78
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,823
So then...

79
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,458
Bararaq!

80
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,816
-Amazing.
-I've never witnessed such battle.

81
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,552
He's fighting an even match
with the Knight-King.

82
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,621
An even match?

83
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,823
If it's an even match at this level,

84
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,058
how upsetting.

85
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,094
I think your power is great.

86
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,665
If it was at its fullest, that is.

87
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,667
I'll show you.

88
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,977
This...?

89
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,180
My servant of Rage and Greatness.

90
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,882
Take shelter within me.

91
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:29,950
Transform my whole body

92
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,085
into that of a great sorcerer.

93
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,656
Sin, you've completed it?

94
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,991
FULL...

95
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:38,925
BODY...

96
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:39,859
DJINN...

97
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:40,860
EQUIP

98
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,531
The Djinn Equip Baal?!

99
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,971
You transform yourself

100
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,707
into a sorcerer,
wearing the power of the Djinn.

101
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,975
This Djinn Equip

102
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,577
manifests the Djinn's true powers.

103
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,915
How much can you endure?

104
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,956
Bararaq.

105
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,235
The force is a lot stronger
than the lightning earlier.

106
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,913
What the heck was that?

107
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,982
What's happening here?

108
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,954
What a mess.

109
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,699
Since it was a bit boisterous there,

110
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,534
I decided to relocate.

111
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,973
This barrier functions like a boundary.

112
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,110
I wouldn't act riotous if I were you.

113
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:08,748
With my powers, I can destroy this
protection wall whenever I want.

114
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,752
Do you really want me to let go?

115
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,765
I'm impressed.

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,868
You caught my lightning

117
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,638
and endured quite a fall.

118
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,941
The power of your Metal Vessel
is excellent.

119
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,944
You're going easy on me, I see.

120
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,814
In your mind, you already won.

121
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,783
Well, I apologize.
I thought I demonstrated

122
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,252
the difference in our abilities
in the battle earlier.

123
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,755
It seems like it wasn't enough.

124
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,925
I should've shown you this from the start.

125
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,929
Bararaq Saiqa.

126
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,821
The mountains.

127
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,356
In one moment!

128
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,092
Do you understand now?

129
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,361
If I have the mind to do it

130
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,397
I could annihilate
the whole country of Sasan.

131
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,702
You haven't acquired your Djinn Equip yet.

132
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,103
It's impossible for you to beat me.

133
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:41,674
-We're both Capturers, but our powers...
-Yes.

134
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,877
If my goal was to invade,

135
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,312
Sasan would've fallen ages ago.

136
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:51,050
Even with the Knight-King present,
Sasan could not have been saved.

137
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,852
What are you doing here?

138
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,654
What business do you have

139
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,156
with this small country?

140
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,825
My intention is

141
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,426
to establish commerce

142
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,062
and form an alliance with this country.

143
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,133
I want to form an equal alliance
with Sasan Kingdom.

144
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,736
That's all I want.

145
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:10,970
What?

146
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,973
Forgive me for my attitude earlier.

147
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,742
It was all done to create

148
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,077
an opportunity to negotiate with you.

149
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,313
Knight-King,

150
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,782
please dismiss my impoliteness.

151
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:27,787
Now, I can get to
the real issue at hand.

152
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,791
Presently,
people are capturing Dungeons worldwide

153
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,893
obtaining great powers.

154
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,363
These powers will eventually
throw the world off-balance,

155
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,900
significantly changing
the distribution of power.

156
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,836
Sasan is no exception.

157
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,839
We'll be forced into a war.

158
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,077
However, I have no desire to make war.

159
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,212
I actually want

160
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,915
to change this world of violence.

161
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:01,921
To bring about a world where
people and nations respect each other,

162
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,390
I want to use this power.

163
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,226
A world where everyone
respects each other?

164
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,729
What a fool.

165
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,965
You actually think that's possible?

166
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,169
Yes, I'm going to start a country
and become its king.

167
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:20,406
I will need an ally who shares
the same motives as me.

168
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,243
I need comrades
who'll change the world with me.

169
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,879
Change the world?

170
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,817
To make that possible, I need you.

171
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,252
The Knight-King of Sasan
Darius Leoxses,

172
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,855
we need your power.

173
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,930
Half an hour has passed
since the Knight-King vanished.

174
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,332
Who are you men?

175
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,934
Speak the truth!

176
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,203
If it's come to this...

177
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,343
What's that?!

178
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,022
-Knight-King...?
-You're safe!

179
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,157
Who won the battle?

180
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,427
This battle was my...

181
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,195
It was a draw.

182
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,433
We were assured in battle

183
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,103
as Capturers of the legendary Dungeon,
we both possess God's power

184
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,040
so it's futile to fight any further.

185
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,075
Your excellency,

186
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,209
isn't the God's power

187
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,446
only reserved
for the Knight-King of Sasan?

188
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,815
Who is this?

189
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,518
According to Sasan legend,

190
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,588
Dungeons only appear when the world
is experiencing abnormal events.

191
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,124
And presently

192
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,994
the world is full of abnormalities
and chaos.

193
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,395
So...

194
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,963
he's also

195
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,399
one of the chosen ones.

196
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,102
Since the world is in a crisis,

197
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,870
I want to welcome him

198
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,039
as a fellow of Sasan.

199
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,911
As a disciple who was chosen
by the same God!

200
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,083
The Knight-King's will is God's will.

201
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,384
We, the Knights

202
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,852
will obey you.

203
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,054
Disciple Sinbad,

204
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,457
we welcome you as a fellow of Sasan!

205
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,231
They're unified.

206
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,408
Are you leaving, Mystras?

207
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,613
I'm going with Sinbad.

208
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,183
Even though I couldn't defeat you

209
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,651
in a duel.

210
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,488
But I've been ready to leave behind

211
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,156
this country and my rank.

212
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,424
Mystras.

213
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,260
As Knight-King

214
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,095
and father,

215
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,598
I've confined you to this land.

216
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,635
I believed that was my duty.

217
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,670
But

218
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,307
maybe I was just jealous of you.

219
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,910
I was once

220
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,079
the same age as you,

221
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,548
and was curious about the outside world.

222
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,585
But I never expressed it.

223
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,454
Go.

224
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,091
As proof of the alliance,

225
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,094
I order you to follow Sinbad.

226
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,631
Walk this world for me.

227
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:37,970
I became stronger because of you.

228
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,973
Since you were the wall,

229
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,710
I was able to stick to my beliefs.

230
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,647
That's why...

231
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,118
Thank you, Father.

232
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,223
Well, that was nerve-racking.

233
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,492
But it turned out to be okay.

234
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,960
Please.

235
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,162
We're the ones cleaning up after you.

236
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,597
Sorry for the wait!

237
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,099
Did you get to say goodbye?

238
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,034
Yes.

239
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,304
I can finally see the outside world.

240
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,439
I can't believe this.

241
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,976
I know you're happy that you can leave,

242
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,712
-but you will work for me.
-Work?

243
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,382
Our alliance with Sasan
is also a trade contract.

244
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,053
You're the contact for those matters.

245
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,555
Ah, that's right.

246
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,058
Am I suited for that duty?

247
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,128
Father and the Knights would
kill me if I caused any trouble for you.

248
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,364
Brother, wait!

249
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,367
Why are you leaving without telling me?

250
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,568
Spartos.

251
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,071
I heard from Father.

252
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,406
You were promoted to Knight

253
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,242
and leaving Sasan for your duty.

254
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,445
You never tell me anything.

255
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,015
Am I a nuisance to you?

256
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,051
That's a misunderstanding, Spartos.

257
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,455
I've just been overwhelmed
with my own issues.

258
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,292
I couldn't manage to do things for you.

259
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,461
Mystras.

260
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,764
You didn't want to cause any harm

261
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,500
to your brother's future
with your rebellious nature.

262
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,236
That's why you kept the distance

263
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,438
is what you really want to say.

264
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,107
Brother.

265
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,545
Brother, no matter
what anyone thinks of you,

266
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,148
you were always curious
and aimed for the outside world.

267
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,784
You always worked hard towards it

268
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,653
and never gave up.

269
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,088
I know that about you.

270
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,392
I respect you from the bottom of my heart.

271
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,396
Now you're leaving.

272
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,832
I feel... lonely.

273
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,705
Don't worry, Spartos.

274
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,373
We'll meet again.

275
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,377
When you grow up
and become a great Knight,

276
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,813
let's travel the world together.

277
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,250
You'll be assigned the same duty as me.

278
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,219
So, don't cry.

279
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,523
You can't become strong
if you keep crying.

280
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,734
<i>It's a promise between Knights.

281
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,336
See you!

282
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,371
<i>Brother.

283
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,440
<i>I'll do my best.

284
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,409
<i>I'm going to travel the world

285
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,111
<i>like you, brother.

286
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,794
Knight-King, you approved of this?

287
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,464
Mystras was defeated in a duel

288
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,667
and now he's joining them
as your representative.

289
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,536
It's not a problem.

290
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,704
No,

291
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,607
I believe that this was the destiny
for my son and Sasan.

292
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:02,908
Destiny?

293
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,144
<i>Sinbad.

294
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,281
<i>Ever since that eccentric man arrived,

295
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:13,886
<i>Sasan was forced to change
<i>for the first time in hundreds of years.

296
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,190
<i>I believe this to be destiny
<i>determined by God.

297
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,664
Change... the world?

298
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,732
To make that happen, I need you.

299
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,269
The Knight-King of Sasan,
Darius Leoxses.

300
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,205
We need your power.

301
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,810
How strange.

302
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,514
When I look at you,

303
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,916
it reminds me of an old Sasan legend.

304
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,184
Legend?

305
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,185
Yeah.

306
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,256
As you know, Sasan has
its own unique faith.

307
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,826
The legend of Sasan starts like this...

308
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,964
<i>The world used to be full of impurities.

309
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,435
<i>The people of Sasan arrived at this land

310
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,871
<i>and used God's power
<i>brought along from their homeland

311
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,973
<i>and cleared out the impurities.

312
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,776
<i>That God

313
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,478
<i>was the almighty King.

314
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,481
<i>The great King
<i>who protected our ancestors.

315
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,984
<i>His greatness was able to calm
<i>all troubles

316
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,521
<i>and established an utopia
<i>where everyone lived in unity.

317
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,624
<i>Our first King was synonymous to God.

318
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,928
It's similar to what you're aiming for.

319
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,531
What was the God's name?

320
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:36,235
The name was lost a long time ago.

321
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:43,342
<i>The world may change
<i>drastically around him.

322
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,679
<i>A Capturer, but still a kid.

323
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,983
<i>I agreed to the alliance

324
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,486
<i>because I saw God in him.

325
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,654
<i>I just have that feeling.

326
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,558
<i>God of Sasan,

327
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,896
<i>please guide these men.

328
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:06,832
This...

329
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,934
is the ocean?

330
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,571
Sinbad.

331
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,674
I was actually frightened.

332
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,943
What if the realities

333
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,779
of the outside world...

334
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,616
disappointed me? What would I do?

335
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,285
That was the uncertainty I felt.

336
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,855
But that's all gone now.

337
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,726
I want to know more about the world!

338
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,530
So, where are we heading to next?

339
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,732
I'll follow you anywhere!

340
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,834
Yes, about that.

341
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,904
We're heading to another small country
like Sasan.

342
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:49,341
Not big countries like
Reim and Parthevia?

343
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,342
Yes.

344
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,045
This country is even more particular
than Sasan.

345
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,349
We were finally approved to enter
the most secluded of the secluded regions!

346
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,319
Ruled by a noble war princess,

347
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,821
it's a matrilineal nation.

348
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,856
<i>A municipal of the sky,

349
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,391
<i>the Artemyra Kingdom.

350
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:11,330
Since that's the case, Mystras,
bear with us.

351
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,432
We have our own circumstances.

352
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,501
What's wrong?

353
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,002
Mystras?

354
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,473
Women... Women?

355
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,042
Women.

356
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,512
So, what do you think
of the outside world?

357
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,880
Isn't it great?

358
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,889
Yes!
