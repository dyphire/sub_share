1
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,793
<i>Sinbad successfully
<i>captured the Dungeon.

2
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,463
<i>In response to the event,

3
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,299
<i>mysterious structures
<i>successively appeared

4
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,334
<i>in the four corners of the world.

5
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:38,705
<i>Since then, many people took on
<i>the challenge of capturing the Dungeons.

6
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:43,610
<i>The world embarked on a period
<i>of Dungeon Capturers.

7
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,219
<i>So, what is Sinbad the Dungeon Capturer
<i>up to now?

8
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,560
<i>He was adrift at sea.

9
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:13,307
Brother. This is your last chance.
Let's get it this time.

10
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,677
It's beneath us.

11
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,765
Darn it.

12
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,141
<i>It's catching up.

13
00:01:59,152 --> 00:01:59,820
This way.

14
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,823
<i>If I don't get it this time,

15
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:07,427
<i>nobody will ever accept me.

16
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,496
I'll capture it

17
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,231
with my great harpoon.

18
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,837
I don't want to be treated...

19
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,241
like a kid anymore!

20
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,598
I'm over here, you monster.

21
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,701
Baal!

22
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,904
Lend me your powers!

23
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,709
Lightning strike!

24
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,326
It's f-freezing!

25
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,429
Iceberg ahead.
Steer to the starboard.

26
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,598
Watch out for the drift ice.

27
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,300
I advise you to slow down.

28
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,836
Unnecessary. Keep going at full speed.

29
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,840
I'm here at your service.

30
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:12,012
Dragul, you failed your quest
for the Dungeon.

31
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,047
His Majesty is enraged.

32
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,584
You also couldn't prevent Sinbad

33
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,786
from disgracing Miss Celendine.

34
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:25,091
By all rights, your military rank
should be revoked.

35
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,829
But things were mediated
by Lieutenant Barbarossa,

36
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,398
giving you a chance to redeem yourself.

37
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,966
My brother...

38
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,642
Our Parthevia Empire's
prided secret force,

39
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,578
Sham Lash.

40
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,746
Lead these assassins

41
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,584
to obtain Sinbad's metal vessel
for his Majesty.

42
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,726
Regarding Sinbad's whereabouts...

43
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,530
He's currently headed northward.

44
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,566
Failure is not an option.

45
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:07,601
Go.

46
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,836
I will fight with my life.

47
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,939
If we proceed in this direction,

48
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,942
we'll hit the unexplored Imuchakk
of the North Pole.

49
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,947
<i>This region is notorious for being
<i>a mecca for savage looters.

50
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,984
<i>He'll be there.

51
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,799
Whoa, I'd say that's a big catch.

52
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,602
Sure is. It's called the Abare narwhal.

53
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,839
They're usually found
in the southern seas,

54
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,009
but once a year,
they head northwards to spawn.

55
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,077
That's amazing.

56
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,047
You were trying to take them down
with just one harpoon?

57
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,152
Brother, did you finally get one?

58
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,421
Well...

59
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,490
You did!

60
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,695
I always believed you were more than
a swimmer! Way to go, brother!

61
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,896
Amazing!

62
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,066
Darn, I wish I saw that.

63
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,535
But why is it burnt?

64
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,504
Hey, who are you?

65
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,039
Are you asking me?

66
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,508
Call me Sinbad.

67
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,611
A beautiful woman is beautiful
anywhere in the world.

68
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,047
What?

69
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,984
<i>Darn it.

70
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,753
-What's your name?
-I'm Pipirika.

71
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,089
Nice to meet you, Pipirika.

72
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:39,759
And... I didn't catch your name yet.

73
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,461
Yeah...

74
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,565
-It's Hina. His name's Hina.

75
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,502
At 21, my brother
still has his childhood name.

76
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,238
But since he caught an Abare narwhal,

77
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,507
he'll finally be granted his warrior name.

78
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,042
I see.

79
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,745
You'll finally be recognized
by "the one," too.

80
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,213
"The one"?

81
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,850
She's fierce and elegant.
Even I admire her, as a woman.

82
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,920
She's the most beautiful woman
in Imuchakk.

83
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,121
Really?

84
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,860
Tell me more about Imuchakk.

85
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,028
Let's see.

86
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,731
Well, it's pure white.

87
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:22,602
Right, but I'm more curious
about its ruler. What kind of king is he?

88
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,904
Our father is the patriarch.

89
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,106
Really?

90
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,542
-That's great. Then take me with you.
-What?

91
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:34,748
Look, Sinbad, outsiders
aren't welcomed in our community.

92
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,117
They'll give you dirty looks.

93
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,551
Doesn't bother me.

94
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,188
It's an unfamiliar country
with unfamiliar people.

95
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,557
I want to see it all,

96
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,726
so I can change the world.

97
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,703
I...

98
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,872
It's beautiful.

99
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,776
You were staring at this all night?

100
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,578
Yup.

101
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,217
I wanted to apologize.

102
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,588
I stole the Abare narwhal from you.

103
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,993
But you were desperate
to save your sister.

104
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,096
That was impressive.

105
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,635
You think so?

106
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,976
Pure white land.

107
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,244
Big, strong people.

108
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:44,050
Strangely built houses and, of course,
the beautiful women.

109
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,688
Imuchakk is a land of snow and ice.

110
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,590
Welcome home.

111
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:54,994
My children.

112
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,030
Father!

113
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,799
-We have returned.
-Yes.

114
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,135
Who are you?

115
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,803
I'm Sinbad.

116
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,273
I venture to all parts of the world.

117
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,943
This is Imuchakk.

118
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,879
-Outsiders are not welcomed.
-But, Father...

119
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,882
-Sinbad is my--
-Dear son,

120
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,786
you're finally one of us, a warrior.

121
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:24,090
You have the responsibility to protect
our people and land from all enemies.

122
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,094
Do not forget that.

123
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,696
Of course.

124
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,702
Tonight is the Maharagan!
Prepare for the feast!

125
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,104
Yeah!

126
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,707
Now...

127
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:45,311
Things are a bit more complicated
since Sinbad wandered into Imuchakk.

128
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,716
The chief of Sham Lash
is already headed there.

129
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,718
What a waste of time.

130
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:56,723
They're the untamable kind
who live in the darkness.

131
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,125
But more importantly...

132
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,734
What's Maharagan?

133
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,204
It's a traditional festival of Imuchakk.

134
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,340
It celebrates those who've achieved
the rite of passage,

135
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,677
and it's also when
their warrior name is given.

136
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,247
It's also a ritual of gratitude
to appreciate the blessing of the harvest.

137
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,349
Since you took him down,

138
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,753
you're officially a warrior tomorrow.

139
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,356
I should tell you
about the strange happenings

140
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,192
that occurred while you were away.

141
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,761
Strange happenings?

142
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,763
An unfamiliar structure

143
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,366
suddenly appeared at
the northern waterfall.

144
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,871
I'm selecting warriors
to go investigate.

145
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,040
Hina, if you can join them--

146
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,274
No.

147
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,377
I advise you to stay away from it.

148
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,478
What?

149
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,781
That's a Dungeon.

150
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,816
Back at my home in Parthevia,

151
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,086
we lost dozens of our people
who attempted to capture it.

152
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,389
I've heard of that before.

153
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,259
The troops who were sent
were totally annihilated,

154
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,095
except for one boy
who succeeded in the capture.

155
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:11,965
That was me.

156
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,401
You can't be serious.

157
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,838
I don't tolerate
those who talk irresponsibly.

158
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,049
Is that your emblem as a capturer?

159
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,352
Indeed.

160
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,288
The djinn from that Dungeon lives in here.

161
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:44,297
In Imuchakk, we bestow
the greatest honor to the braves.

162
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,265
I hope you forgive my rudeness.

163
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,144
It's natural to be vigilant of outsiders.

164
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,346
Especially when you're the patriarch

165
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,382
who's responsible for the whole clan.

166
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,952
So I ask of you.

167
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,988
Don't let anyone near the Dungeon.

168
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,391
Understood. I trust your word.

169
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,095
Brother, have you told her
about the good news yet?

170
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,397
No, I...

171
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,967
Now that you're an adult,
you can go to her--

172
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,435
Quit it.

173
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,337
I can't do that now.

174
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,406
Brother? What's going on?

175
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,342
-It's about to commence!
-Hurry!

176
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,347
Tonight is the Maharagan.

177
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:38,284
Let us celebrate the birth of a warrior
and the harvest of the sea.

178
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,451
Since you took that thing down,

179
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:15,021
you're officially a warrior tomorrow.

180
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,290
<i>Wrong.

181
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,426
<i>Heard he ran from
<i>the Abare narwhal again.

182
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:24,530
<i>I'm sorry. I can't see someone
<i>who's not a warrior.

183
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,565
<i>What a joke.

184
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,567
<i>You failed again?

185
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,870
<i>-You must become a warrior.
<i>-Aren't you the patriarch's son?

186
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,439
<i>Brother, I know you can do it.

187
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,310
My son, hurry up
and become a warrior already.

188
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,279
I...

189
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,115
Hey, brother.

190
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,253
I always find you here
whenever something's bothering you.

191
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,924
I miss those days...

192
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,294
<i>Wow, you're talented.

193
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,030
<i>Pipirika, did you finish yours?

194
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,332
<i>Oh, don't mind me.

195
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,669
<i>You'll get better with practice.
<i>I'll teach you.

196
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:04,604
<i>Thanks.

197
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,274
<i>I want to see you defeat them.

198
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:09,942
<i>Sure.

199
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,948
You're gonna become a warrior.
Of course you'll feel a lot of pressure.

200
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,552
But will you promise me that
you'll still be my gentle brother

201
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,255
even when you're a warrior?

202
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,426
Let's go. Tonight's about you.

203
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,194
-Yeah.
-Come on.

204
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:33,065
Let's go before Father
gets Sinbad way too drunk.

205
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,942
You're beautiful.

206
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,045
But a little too tall.

207
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,247
<i>So he's our target.

208
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,649
Hey, wait.

209
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,352
<i>This'll be easy.

210
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,954
<i>Die.

211
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,324
Hey, wait up.

212
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,600
A kid?

213
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,734
Darn.

214
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,637
You'll be punished for your mischief!

215
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,147
That's all you've got?

216
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,383
I knew I could take you down alone.

217
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,454
What are you smiling about?

218
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,989
Sucks for you.

219
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,100
So...

220
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,402
Who the heck are you?

221
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,271
Were you sent by Parthevia?

222
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,507
You bastard.

223
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,043
I can't believe kids like you
are becoming assassins now.

224
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,413
What's with that attitude?

225
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,083
At such a young age,

226
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,185
I don't know where you came from,

227
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,586
but your parents would be disappointed.

228
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,054
Shut up.

229
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,523
What's wrong with you?

230
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,359
How can you speak like that
to your elders?

231
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,660
Sinbad.

232
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,730
You gotta be more strict with him.
He's an assassin, after all.

233
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,031
I know that.

234
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,734
That's why I'm disciplining him
on his speech.

235
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,070
What? But it's not about discipline.

236
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,808
These types require discipline
in the basic of basics.

237
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:23,743
Understood?

238
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,748
That kind of attitude is what gets you
into trouble, like assassination.

239
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,751
Don't you feel like
you're disgracing your parents?

240
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,753
I told you to shut up!

241
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,188
My parents are long gone!

242
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,624
I murdered them when I was six!

243
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,628
What? Scared of me now?

244
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,800
Don't boast about that.

245
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,737
Poor kid.

246
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,614
Don't look at me like that.

247
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,817
You're just a kid yourself, so shut up!

248
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,188
Sinbad!

249
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,723
Take that.

250
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,427
<i>Don't come near me.

251
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,830
<i>You don't understand.

252
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,206
Chief, are you injured?

253
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,141
Shut up.

254
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,213
I'm gonna be the one to kill

255
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,616
Sinbad!

256
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,285
Where did they come from?

257
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,554
Is your wound okay?

258
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,222
It's nothing serious.

259
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,158
We gotta prepare for the ritual now.

260
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,828
But wait, who were those guys?

261
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,364
They must be from the Parthevian Army.

262
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,832
They were sent to capture me.

263
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:53,833
What?

264
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,768
That means you're a wanted man.

265
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,236
But why?

266
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,673
I betrayed the country,
and I did a lot of other things.

267
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,242
Aren't you scared?

268
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:08,547
You can never return home and you'll be
targeted by assassins all your life.

269
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:12,284
I decided to follow my destiny.

270
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,922
I'll overcome every obstacle
that comes my way.

271
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,427
<i>Sin...

272
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,630
<i>I...

273
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,367
The sun's about to rise.

274
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,770
Brother, it's almost time.

275
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,206
Can I meet you there?

276
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,243
I need a minute to calm down before I go.

277
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,579
All right. But make it quick, okay?

278
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,248
See you later.

279
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,824
Hurry. We don't want to miss it.

280
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,826
Sinbad!

281
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,963
It's Brother.

282
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,968
Brother's going to the Dungeon...

283
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,971
to prove himself as a true warrior.

284
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,708
<i>Is it possible?

285
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,744
<i>If I can obtain
<i>the Dungeon's power myself,

286
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,979
<i>could I be as strong as you?

287
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,453
The Dungeon kills all,

288
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,489
except those who are worthy
of being a King's candidate.

289
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,625
Tens of thousands of men lost their lives

290
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,761
because of their ambitions.

291
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,397
Then my brother...

292
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,765
Don't worry.

293
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,301
I won't let him die.

294
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:39,405
But how can you guarantee

295
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,707
that you'll come back alive?

296
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,010
I just know.

297
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,682
I'm not gonna... die.

298
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,430
This place...

299
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,371
<i>Do not cower.

300
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,273
<i>I can do it.

301
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,812
<i>If I obtain the Dungeon's power,

302
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,314
<i>I can be a true warrior.

303
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,483
<i>Then everyone will approve of me.

304
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,489
<i>What's this?

305
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,397
Where am I?

306
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,707
This...

307
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,911
is the Dungeon?

308
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,825
Were you guided by the powers
of the Dungeon again?

309
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,494
Sinbad...

310
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:14,400
what is it that you see with your eyes?

311
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,866
Sinbad.

312
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,202
Is this our fate?

313
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,737
I'm gonna kill him.

314
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:03,976
I'll never let anyone get in my way.
