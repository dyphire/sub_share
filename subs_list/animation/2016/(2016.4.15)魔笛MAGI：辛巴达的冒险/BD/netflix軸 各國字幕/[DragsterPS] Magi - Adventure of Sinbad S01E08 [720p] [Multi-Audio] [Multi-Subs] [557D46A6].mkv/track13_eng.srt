1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,016
Amazing! He's a real Capturer!

2
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,086
That lightning must be
the power of the spirit!

3
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,288
Dungeons really exist!

4
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:32,666
Harun!

5
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:37,070
I'm impressed.
It's like being at the amphitheater.

6
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,605
Yes, all thanks to you.

7
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,742
-Sinbad!
-Indeed.

8
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,578
This is something only you,
a Capturer can do.

9
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,147
What a brilliant idea.

10
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:48,682
It's all...

11
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,285
because of you, Harun.

12
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,287
You were the one who said that

13
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,189
my stories were more entertaining
than a court poet's.

14
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,092
You even said I was living a dream
and you were in awe.

15
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,661
That made me realize

16
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:05,132
that adventure stories can captivate
and excite anybody.

17
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,268
I was once captivated as a child, too.

18
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:13,173
But I'm still very far
from a thousand gold coins.

19
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,676
And today's the promised day.

20
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,314
Will you please give me more time?

21
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,550
I will fulfill my terms no matter what!

22
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,385
I won't give up.

23
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,228
This is my listening fee to you.

24
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,564
Accept this, Sinbad.

25
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,399
As your comrade,

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,637
I'll support your dream.

27
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,372
So, our promise...

28
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,443
You have a big future ahead of you,
my friend.

29
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,447
There's no time for you to waste.

30
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,651
Harun. No, mentor!

31
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,419
Who are you?

32
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,555
Oh, there you are.

33
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,458
Please give us notice before you go out.

34
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,597
He's the 22nd king of Balbadd.

35
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,767
His Excellency King Rashid!

36
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:25,145
<i>I would've stayed in Reim
<i>if I knew I'd be doing this!

37
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,816
Ja'far, before you waste
your time complaining,

38
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,351
move your hands!

39
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,321
You still have a pile of
unfinished work here.

40
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,892
I never signed up to do this!

41
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,262
I've had enough!
I'd rather swim back to Reim!

42
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,730
Quit it, Ja'far!

43
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,499
Please calm down!

44
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,535
Stop! Just let me go!

45
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,772
Ja'far, follow me.

46
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,510
I understand how painful and tedious

47
00:02:56,576 --> 00:03:00,313
it is for you to concentrate on studying.

48
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,384
You never experienced it

49
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,553
while you were raised among assassins.

50
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,761
You feel strongly that you're here

51
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,299
<i>to serve your leader,
<i>not to hit the books.

52
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,735
Is that correct?

53
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,238
But you already made the decision

54
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,841
to change the way you live.

55
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,611
You want to protect Sinbad

56
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,282
and stay in Reim,
which is how I feel as well.

57
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,817
That's why

58
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,653
you must work hard right now

59
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,758
to repay your master,
who led you towards a new life.

60
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,361
Isn't that right, Ja'far?

61
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,800
What's going on?!

62
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,002
Ja'far.

63
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,673
I must tell you something.

64
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,777
I'm... actually...

65
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,514
expecting a child soon!

66
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,349
What?!

67
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,886
The Imuchakk always lived in
harsh environments.

68
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,656
So the women give birth only a few months
after conception.

69
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,725
This is also part of your studies.

70
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,828
Let me teach you about midwifery.

71
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,932
I'm counting on you.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,335
He's your little brother.

73
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,737
I'm grateful beyond words.

74
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,406
I was approved to join the union.

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,410
Now I'm able to do business in Napolia.

76
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,847
I'm eager to see the new goods
arrive from Imuchakk.

77
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,517
Sinbad, why don't we organize
a theater performance?

78
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,152
Excuse me?

79
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,121
But, mentor,

80
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,759
I was only performing to raise funds
for the union admission fee.

81
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,028
I don't need to do that anymore.

82
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,098
You're quite mature for your age,

83
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,734
but still an amateur merchant.

84
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,438
You joined the union,
but you still haven't set up a shop.

85
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,142
How about a warehouse
to store your inventory

86
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,411
and a carriage to transport goods?

87
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,547
You must advertise your new shop, too.

88
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,652
You must work very hard to build
a strong foundation now.

89
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,619
I see.

90
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,522
<i>In Reim, as you know,

91
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,760
<i>there's a policy to sponsor
<i>various amusements for its citizens.

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,066
<i>The gladiators at the Colosseum,
<i>gambling houses, bath houses and theater.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,538
The gladiators and the theater attract
the most citizens.

94
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,640
Gladiators and theater?

95
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,777
I advise against becoming a gladiator.

96
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,712
It's a severe spectacle

97
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,517
where you're forced to fight,
at times, even beasts.

98
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,622
Presently, your body
is the only asset you possess.

99
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,925
You can't afford to
expose yourself to danger.

100
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,060
Yes.

101
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:45,465
Your adventure stories are
solid performances.

102
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,970
It would be the talk of the town
if you performed it in a theater.

103
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:54,741
I believe this is the best thing to do
for your business to flourish.

104
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,543
What do you think?

105
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,046
I'll do it.

106
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,016
I'll start preparing for it now.

107
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,688
I owe you a lot, mentor!

108
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,932
Your Excellency,
the carriage is stationed over there.

109
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,736
We planned on taking it
to the meeting at the court.

110
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,806
I don't mind.
It'll be quicker to walk anyway.

111
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,708
As you wish.

112
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,116
You seem to be having fun, my king.

113
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,887
Maybe a little.

114
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,259
Boo!

115
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,064
Look! He laughed!

116
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,934
I've completed my assignment.

117
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,670
Already? That was quick!

118
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,545
Everything's correct. Well done!

119
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,781
I'm proud of you, Ja'far!

120
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,818
So, I'll go help out Vittel now.

121
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:14,854
Ja'far.

122
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,095
While we go fix dinner,

123
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,297
please look after Kikiriku.

124
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,232
Isn't he adorable?

125
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,868
Daddy's gotta do some work now.

126
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,604
Have fun playing with your brother!

127
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,611
He... weighs a ton.

128
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,887
It says he's the rumored Dungeon Capturer,

129
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,156
but I wonder if that's true.

130
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,359
It made it onto the program
at the last minute.

131
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,762
Could be bogus.

132
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:00,166
We can always leave if we don't like it.

133
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:13,646
Welcome to the world of
action-packed adventure!

134
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,218
How did he get up there?!

135
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,001
Cool!

136
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,137
I've never seen this before.

137
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,938
They look like stars!

138
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,040
Wow.

139
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,376
Tonight you'll hear

140
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,946
the adventure stories
of a boy named Sinbad.

141
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,784
Enjoy the show to your heart's content.

142
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:59,092
<i>Witnessing the power of the Djinn
<i>and listening to stories of the Dungeon,

143
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,130
<i>the audience was enthralled.

144
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:09,302
<i>They said this performance beats any play

145
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,272
<i>or large-scale chorus.

146
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,944
<i>Its reputation spread beyond
<i>Napolia to all corners of Reim

147
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:23,249
<i>and the people lining up
<i>for the sold-out performance grew daily.

148
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,208
<i>This is how...

149
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,113
<i>everyone in town came to know who he was.

150
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,254
It was a great success.

151
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:02,422
Yes.

152
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:06,025
Again, it's thanks to you
for suggesting the idea to me.

153
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,396
But it was unfortunate for the many

154
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,499
who weren't able to enter the theater.

155
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,070
I would like to find a solution for that.

156
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,307
You are a shameless businessman.

157
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,076
Do you think so?

158
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,325
What's that?

159
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,928
Is it your first time seeing it?

160
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,297
That's the Colosseum.

161
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,073
First, let's prepare to unload!

162
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,109
Are you Mr. Hinahoho?

163
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,945
Yup, that's me.

164
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,181
I am Sinbad's errand boy.

165
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,850
Sinbad's?

166
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,085
I drove the carriage to pick you up.

167
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,790
Rurumu and I will take care of unloading

168
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,058
so you guys go ahead.

169
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,127
Kikiriku, come here.

170
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:17,497
My...

171
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,099
He's totally attached to Ja'far now.

172
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,236
It's fine, I can take care of him.

173
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,806
I appreciate it.

174
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,907
Yes.

175
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,411
I'll come back for the rest of you later.

176
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,412
Thanks.

177
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,123
This...

178
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,359
Sinbad finally reached Imuchakk

179
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,928
after powering through the raging waves.

180
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,364
With the tribal leader's son, Hinahoho,

181
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,867
he entered the Dungeon Valefor.

182
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,502
Sinbad?

183
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,571
What's he doing here?!

184
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,009
The two were also followed by

185
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,078
the mysterious assassins squad.

186
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,446
What's happening?

187
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:11,184
The performances he started
in order to raise funds

188
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,453
required a venue bigger than the theater.

189
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:18,491
For the first time in history, a theater
performance is held at the Colosseum.

190
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,863
This would impress anybody.

191
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,898
Hey, Kikiriku?

192
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,069
Jeez, what a troublemaker.

193
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,909
I seriously doubt he came all this way...

194
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,547
You had me worried there for a second.

195
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,275
<i>He's...

196
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,011
<i>the monster of the Colosseum!

197
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,614
This is the magic of darkness!

198
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,518
The Black Rukh turns people into demons!

199
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,454
<i>The demon will become whole.

200
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,191
<i>Use the power of Baal to blow him away
<i>before that happens!

201
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,161
Sinbad?

202
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,533
What is it?!

203
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,703
I'll save my comrades no matter what.

204
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,609
<i>I must save him.

205
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,130
Then I'll...

206
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,967
distract him!

207
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,513
Sham Lash-style assassination!

208
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:21,681
Kunai!

209
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,116
<i>You're dead!

210
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,691
<i>I missed his heart.

211
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,467
<i>I refuse to die here.

212
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,337
<i>Killing was my only specialty.

213
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,173
<i>I'm not worth anything if I fail now!

214
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,244
<i>This is your true form.

215
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,147
You've been suffering a life

216
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,584
of contradiction and lies.

217
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,554
Shut it! What do you know?!

218
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,292
You're right. There's no way I would know.

219
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,060
But...

220
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,200
if you don't have a home,
I'll provide it for you.

221
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:19,739
I'll be your guiding light. You don't
need to live a life of lies anymore.

222
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,041
Now that...

223
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,578
we've met.

224
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:32,051
<i>No... no... I've changed.

225
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,454
<i>All of them, especially him,

226
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,758
<i>led me out of an assassin's life.

227
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,129
<i>The reason I'm here... that's...

228
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,199
Did you hear me?
I'll never let my comrades die!

229
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,603
That's why I'll never let you die!

230
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,608
<i>I must save my comrades.

231
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,811
<i>I must save Kikiriku!

232
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,718
<i>Demand your power, my Household.

233
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,289
<i>Born from Baal, the Djinn of lightning,
<i>the Household of lightning!

234
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,365
No.

235
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:21,867
Not yet!

236
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,773
Come! Ja'far!

237
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,143
Household Vessel, Bararaq Sei!

238
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,585
You're safe... now.

239
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,161
Are you okay, Ja'far?

240
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,700
Huh? Sin?

241
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,136
Where's Kikiriku?!

242
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,371
Ouch.

243
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,306
The baby's safe.

244
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,575
He's with Vittel and Mahado.

245
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,444
-He's fine.
-I'm glad.

246
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,747
I'm relieved that you're not hurt.

247
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,750
I was attacked by a monster

248
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,885
and lightning shot out of this.

249
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,353
Lightning?

250
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,891
It's radiating like my sword.

251
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,795
Did Baal's power enhance your weapon?

252
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:29,502
If I'm the first Capturer,
you're the first Djinn warrior!

253
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,338
Yup.

254
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,310
Ja'far.

255
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,714
You risked your life to save Kikiriku.

256
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,949
It's not a big deal.

257
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:45,618
Thank you.

258
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,289
You are a courageous boy
with a heart of gold.

259
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,660
I've no doubt you'll become a great man.

260
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,796
You're also...

261
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,332
my precious first child.

262
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:06,605
Yes.

263
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,946
We were only gone for a couple months
and we return to this?!

264
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,448
This is...

265
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,751
The Sindria Trading Company?!

266
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,254
What the heck happened?!

267
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,628
Hey, everyone.

268
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,963
Sinbad?!

269
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,866
What did I say?

270
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,236
Now we can do business in Reim

271
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,339
and travel the world
to expand our business!

272
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,976
Well done, Sinbad.

273
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,779
No, I owe it all to you, mentor.

274
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,481
<i>Mentor?!

275
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,550
Without you, the business wouldn't exist.

276
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,319
I wouldn't be who I am now.

277
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,922
No need to thank me.
I was delightfully entertained

278
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,459
by your fabulous performances
during my stay here.

279
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,762
Your adventure stories

280
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,997
should be published as a book.

281
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,668
I must return to Balbadd now.

282
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,872
It's too bad but we must part ways here.

283
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,008
When you visit, be sure to stop by
the royal palace.

284
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,379
Of course, you'll come to me to negotiate
business with my country.

285
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,381
Yes, mentor!

286
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,421
Farewell, Sinbad!

287
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,657
Who's that mentor guy?

288
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,893
He's certainly not a commoner.

289
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,797
Well, he's someone who taught me a lot.

290
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,465
The king of Balbadd.

291
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,933
King?!

292
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,002
What have you been doing?!

293
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,805
Don't worry about the details.

294
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,508
We finally get to do
as much business as we want.

295
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,845
We can't fall back here.

296
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,482
This business exists only
as an asset to my own nation.

297
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,019
Don't forget, our goal is to start
our own country!

298
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,689
Of course, if you say so!

299
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,426
<i>Shortly thereafter, Sinbad

300
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,963
<i>wrote an autobiography,
<i>as recommended by King Rashid.

301
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,769
<i>It was meant to be a marketing effort
<i>for the upcoming business,

302
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,606
<i>but it will later establish itself
<i>as a world classic

303
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,075
<i>known as Adventures of Sinbad.

304
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,653
It's a fresh new start
for the Sindria Trading Company!

305
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,022
Yeah!
