1
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:20,754
This...

2
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,291
is the Dungeon?

3
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,537
<i>I heard it's supposed to be
<i>a dangerous place...

4
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,080
<i>Are they... eating me?

5
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,249
Darn it.

6
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:00,460
No. I can't die like this.

7
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,628
Then what?

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,781
I'm gonna get out alive no matter what.

9
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,788
<i>That door...

10
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,821
<i>I'm not a coward any more.

11
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,656
<i>The power is mine.

12
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,777
Gotcha.

13
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,954
Well that didn't take long.

14
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,823
Let me have some more fun, Vittel.

15
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,692
Sorry about that, chief.

16
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,894
<i>That's the kid from yesterday.

17
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,435
Stop. Be more cautious.

18
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,004
Shut up. Don't order me around.

19
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,673
What the heck is this?

20
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,409
It's the key that unlocks the door.

21
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,313
It'll lead us to the treasure vault.

22
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,584
Hey! Give that back.

23
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,621
You were with Sinbad last night.

24
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,656
Where is he?

25
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,858
-That key is mine.
-What?

26
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,628
Ignore him.
We'll head to the treasure vault.

27
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,863
Sinbad will definitely show up there.

28
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,665
I'll hold onto the key.

29
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,835
Let's move.
Don't waste time on a small fry.

30
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,471
Wait.

31
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,775
I said, wait!

32
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,077
What's his problem?

33
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:18,952
Is... Is this...?

34
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,989
The power of the notoriously known
predatory tribe...

35
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,025
Imuchakk of Far North!

36
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,561
Jeez, what a drag.

37
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,396
Vittel. Mahado.

38
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,999
Easy, easy, now.

39
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,972
Let's get started.

40
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,682
You're going down.

41
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:01,995
Eat this.

42
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,501
I'll finish you...

43
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,403
now!

44
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,510
Bararaq Saiqa.

45
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,416
-Darn it.
-Shoot.

46
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,586
Boy, that was close, Hina.

47
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,456
Sinbad, why are you here?

48
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,658
Well done for making it all the way here.

49
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:36,396
It's been a while, Sinbad.

50
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,765
Who are they again?

51
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,436
I never forget a lady's face,
but I'm bad with guys.

52
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,005
You savage.

53
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,941
Still got a bad sense of humor, huh?

54
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,544
Knew we'd meet again, Drakon.

55
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,814
How do you do?

56
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,851
I'm Falan, the imperial advisor sorcerer.

57
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,153
It's an honor to meet you.

58
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,757
Sinbad.

59
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,460
You're mine to kill!

60
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:08,862
Stop.

61
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,464
I won't be satisfied until I kill you.

62
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,667
I guess he's still upset.

63
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,135
Hey, blockhead.

64
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,971
We'll take care of you.

65
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,806
Hey.

66
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,014
I got this.

67
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,689
Calm down, will you?

68
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,192
How can you read my attacks?

69
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:41,995
It's all intuitive.

70
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,599
<i>He's got...

71
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,669
<i>nothing on me!

72
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,544
You're done for.

73
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,045
Darn it.

74
00:07:59,112 --> 00:07:59,980
Vittel.

75
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,247
Baal--

76
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,156
I'll get you this time.

77
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,670
What do you think of this?

78
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,172
Thalg Hajar.

79
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,226
<i>I'm not sure that even a sorcerer

80
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,561
<i>from Musta'sim,
<i>the land of advanced magic,

81
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,830
<i>can handle this.

82
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,234
<i>Who is this sorcerer?

83
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,103
He got away this time...

84
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,707
but I'm not impressed
by you Sham Lash people, either.

85
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,275
What did you say?

86
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,110
Can you blame me?

87
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:08,815
You can't even capture a mere child
or a barbarian.

88
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,151
Drink this.

89
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,218
Huh?

90
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,219
What's that?

91
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,623
A magic tool that'll heal your wounds.

92
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,994
We can't let Sinbad get ahead of us.

93
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,101
Amazing. My body feels lighter.

94
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,906
So, what's the plan now?

95
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,307
Don't worry about it.

96
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,944
Once you enter a Dungeon,
there's only one goal.

97
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,052
Well, that ice was something, huh?

98
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,855
You saved me this time.

99
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,223
Why did you follow me here?

100
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,627
Why are you here?

101
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,730
It's all because of you, that I'm...

102
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,799
Lightning strike!

103
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,005
I'm gonna obtain power
from this Dungeon.

104
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,211
What exactly is the power you seek?

105
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,248
You're already strong enough.

106
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:40,807
This must be it.
Dragul, it's time to summon the Djinn.

107
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,075
Yeah.

108
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,955
I'm Valefor.

109
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,659
Who shall be the next king?

110
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,228
This is the Djinn of this Dungeon?

111
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,830
I smell it.

112
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,702
Don't think you can hide from me
in that fake vessel of yours.

113
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:14,874
I remember that vile stench
from the other world.

114
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,776
Hey.

115
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,078
Vanish.

116
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,451
Falan turned into a doll.

117
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,121
What happened?

118
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,924
The Djinn was familiar with my scent.

119
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,794
But I left something
that'll entertain them.

120
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,263
Lieutenant Barbarossa.

121
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,169
Who's the King Vessel?

122
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,839
That'll be me. I'll form a pact with you.

123
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,176
What will you do with the king's power?

124
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:55,214
Of course, I'll return to Parthevia
to serve his Majesty.

125
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:04,090
Augh, really? Well that's disappointing.

126
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,160
I put in way too much energy for this.

127
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,263
I'm asking what you want to do

128
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,732
when you obtain the king's power.

129
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,002
If you have no desires,
then you're not worthy.

130
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,073
We finally made it.
Hey, Drakon!

131
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,808
Sinbad?

132
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,044
Finally, seems like we're all here now.

133
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:28,348
The challengers of the Dungeon.

134
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:33,219
The one who passes this test
will be crowned king.

135
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,254
The king's power is almighty.

136
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,357
In one night,
it'll destroy an entire country

137
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,761
and grant you enough wealth
to rebuild another country.

138
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,831
Now, who will be the next king?

139
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,471
So being the king means to slack off
for the rest of my life.

140
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,239
And you're saying that I have a chance?

141
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,810
Of course.
There's potential in all of you.

142
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,445
That includes you.

143
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,147
What do you mean?

144
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,883
Because you might become

145
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:08,321
a King Vessel after you pass this test.

146
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,256
<i>Is that pity?

147
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,159
<i>But this is my last chance.

148
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,163
Chief, we're going to participate too.

149
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,466
Never even thought of leaving the force,

150
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,468
but things have changed.

151
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,872
I'm game.

152
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,075
Get ready for a bloodbath.

153
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,844
<i>I'm here to be stronger.

154
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,048
<i>To become the warrior everyone respects.

155
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,550
<i>This time, I'll do it on my own.

156
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,886
All right, count me in.

157
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,823
Sinbad? But you already...

158
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,392
Baal isn't enough for you?

159
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,894
You're insatiable.

160
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,296
Sure, whatever you say.

161
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,099
I won't let you have it.

162
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:58,104
The power is mine. I won't let anyone
take it away from me.

163
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,840
This is getting better.

164
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,243
I can see the ambition burning
in your eyes.

165
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,314
Here's the last enemy you'll face.

166
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:12,585
Say hi to my offspring, Minifor.

167
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,125
The final test is to catch him.

168
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,060
What do you mean, exactly?

169
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,597
The one who catches him first

170
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,933
obtains the power of the king.

171
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,301
Huh?

172
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,338
If nobody's able to catch him

173
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,907
by the time all this water falls,

174
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,045
you'll be trapped in this Dungeon forever.

175
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,317
Well, that's easy. Watch this.

176
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,655
Can you catch him?

177
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,663
He's mine.

178
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,666
Sorry, my hands slipped.

179
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,937
If that's what you're gonna do,
I've got an idea too.

180
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,106
Yeah? Try me.

181
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,342
<i>Yes, yes, go on.

182
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,178
<i>Humans never change.

183
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,013
Wait a minute.

184
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,282
Keep it cool, everyone.

185
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,519
The only way to survive
is to work together.

186
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,555
Nonsense. Only one of us can be king.

187
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,924
How can we work together?

188
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,060
But what if Valefor's manipulating us?

189
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,464
He's too difficult to catch alone.

190
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,033
But we will, if we work together.

191
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,502
So what's the plan, exactly?

192
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,940
We'll surround Minifor to trap him

193
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,342
and attack all at once.

194
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,612
No hard feelings,
regardless of who ends up catching him.

195
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,681
Who cues the attack?

196
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,651
The one who cues
is obviously at an advantage.

197
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,054
Then I'll give the cue.

198
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,256
-What?
-You.

199
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,559
That's why I won't participate.

200
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,062
I won't take part in this attack.

201
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,065
I already got one anyway.

202
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,469
Isn't it more important
to come out of this Dungeon alive?

203
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,009
Keep calm.
Maintain the same distance from each other

204
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,177
and get closer.

205
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,313
We have just one chance.

206
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,382
<i>Something... Something's wrong.

207
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,090
He's mine.

208
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,227
I'm gonna catch him.

209
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,595
The king's power.

210
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,264
<i>There's no way he gave up on this.

211
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,167
<i>Is he serious?

212
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,769
<i>Then I shall be the one.

213
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,505
Now!

214
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,084
He jumped?

215
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,394
Got him.

216
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,230
That was a close call.

217
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,565
Sinbad.

218
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,567
You're a traitor, after all.

219
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,570
How dare you steal from me again?

220
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,674
I knew I should've killed you
a long time ago.

221
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,543
Are you sure?

222
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,450
You couldn't have escaped
this Dungeon otherwise.

223
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,389
And if you didn't work with me...

224
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,691
I wouldn't have escaped either.

225
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,496
It's not about who's right or wrong.

226
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:47,400
But someone had to obtain the king's power

227
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,602
and I was the chosen one.

228
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:54,307
Why? Because the one
who desires this Djinn the most

229
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,175
is me.

230
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,114
You can't sleep?

231
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,318
This is the path he chose.

232
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,722
Looks like Sinbad followed him.

233
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,326
I'm not gonna die.

234
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,730
He had a serious look on his face.

235
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,333
But...

236
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,503
What were you going to do
with this power anyway?

237
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:30,743
I'm going to use this power to create
a country that'll change the world.

238
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,745
A country?

239
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,480
That changes the world?

240
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:38,284
I have dreamt about it
since I left Parthevia.

241
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,653
When I got to Imuchakk, an allied nation,

242
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,656
my goal was defined.

243
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,227
I want to create a world

244
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,497
where people and countries
help each other.

245
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:57,403
I'm going to create a country
that connects them all.

246
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,674
Changing the world, the nations,
is not that simple.

247
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,711
What you preach is an empty dream!

248
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,548
That's why I'm gonna make it happen.

249
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,220
Sinbad, the boy who captured

250
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:18,424
the first Dungeon
that appeared in this world.

251
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,561
He will change the world
with his new country.

252
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,731
What do you think about that?
Doesn't it excite you?

253
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,801
I'll make it happen...

254
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,803
no matter what.

255
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,945
<i>What's happening?

256
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,951
<i>Sinbad's words
<i>are making me passionate.

257
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:54,560
His eyes were so powerful,
they captivate you.

258
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,871
I ask all of you
to create that country with me.

259
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:11,277
<i>I want to follow this man.

260
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,380
In order to make that a reality,
I need support.

261
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,717
Talented merchants, diplomats...

262
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,586
spies, and of course...

263
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,591
those willing to join me in the adventure,
exploring the world.

264
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,296
<i>This is the King Vessel?

265
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,899
I still have some way to go
to fulfill my dream.

266
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:39,939
I want more power, support,
and everything else.

267
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,510
So, all of you, gather around me.

268
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,915
Are you serious about having us join you?

269
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,254
Of course. I want all of you to join me.

270
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:57,990
Mahad.

271
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,662
Sure, I'll join you too.

272
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:04,697
Chief?

273
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,767
The force has been a great bore
these days.

274
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,569
Count me in.

275
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:13,672
Yeah.

276
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,578
You idiot.

277
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,815
Did you really think
I was going to obey you?

278
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,584
No.

279
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,754
I'm going to convince you, too.

280
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,666
What's going on?

281
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,473
My body's burning inside.

282
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,575
Who's inside of me?

283
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,582
What's going on?

284
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,987
It's begun.

285
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,765
I'm not allowing this in my Dungeon.

286
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,367
At this rate, the demon will become whole.

287
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,637
Use Baal's power to blow him up.

288
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,508
Sinbad?

289
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:27,880
What are you doing?

290
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,017
I'll save my comrades no matter what.
