1
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,893
<i>What's that sound?

2
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,441
Wake up, both of you!
Snakes everywhere!

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,193
What should we do?

4
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,696
Ja'far, Mystras! Live on for me!

5
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,173
Let's restore our energy by eating this!

6
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,633
Ja'far...

7
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,885
You're... going to eat that?

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,265
I've strangled and eaten many of these
during my assassin years.

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,935
Let's eat!

10
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:00,936
Yes!

11
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,356
Take your time, there's plenty of them!

12
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:15,367
All right, I'm done butchering snakes
for tonight.

13
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,746
Ja'far, are you making progress with that?

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,914
Yeah.

15
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,501
I've finished weaving this cloth
made from tree barks.

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,379
Wow. I'm impressed, Ja'far.

17
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,340
There's been so many squalls recently.

18
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,926
Let's hope this prevents leakage.

19
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,303
Hey, guys!

20
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,930
Check this out.

21
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,642
A sturdy branch washed ashore,
thanks to the rain the other day.

22
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,312
Great! That's perfect building wood.

23
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,523
All right! Let's repair the house
this afternoon.

24
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,152
But let's have lunch first.
It's all ready to eat.

25
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,320
-Yes!
-Yes!

26
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,368
Yet another day of snake meat...

27
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,663
I'm getting sick of this flavor.

28
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:03,999
Ja'far.

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,751
Here.

30
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,794
Is this rock salt?!

31
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,714
I found it exposed on the cliff behind.

32
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,132
Way to go, Sin!

33
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,135
This one's ready, too.

34
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,220
Go for it, Mystras.

35
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,641
Wow, that looks delicious!

36
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,103
But... wait a minute!

37
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,815
Why are we adapting to this lifestyle?!

38
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,443
This is absurd!

39
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,781
Don't you remember why we're here
in the first place?

40
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,450
The reason why we're here?

41
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,079
-That's right, to survive.
-That's right, to survive.

42
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,334
You've got to be kidding me!

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,014
This is the Artemyra Kingdom.

44
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,852
We were tossed to the bottom of the valley
because we enraged the queen.

45
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,148
Our goal was to establish diplomacy
with Artemyra.

46
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:37,569
So, we must return alive
and face the queen again!

47
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,739
I vaguely remember,
now that you've mentioned it.

48
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,741
I remember, too.

49
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,658
Then...!

50
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,162
But I'm pretty comfortable
living here now.

51
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,748
Oh, this one's ready, too.

52
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,041
Thanks.

53
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,796
It's surely a lot more pleasant
than my Sham Lash years.

54
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,547
No!

55
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,675
I realized something by living here.

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,472
When I was young,
food was scarce because of the war.

57
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,933
We all helped each other out,

58
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,727
desperately trying to survive each day.

59
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,649
But... I'd forgotten about those times.

60
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,901
I ate excessively well in Reim.

61
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,404
Sleeping in a warm bed
had become the norm.

62
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,282
I was far from being poor.

63
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:29,496
I've come to realize how I was living
a luxurious and blessed lifestyle.

64
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,084
Living in the bottom of the valley
has humbled me quite a bit.

65
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,797
I'm grateful for the blessings
of the sun and nature.

66
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,051
I pay respects to the animals
who give us their lives.

67
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,471
Yes, this...

68
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,183
is truly what it means "to live."

69
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,437
Sin...

70
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,524
A complete waste of time.

71
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,027
I didn't ask you for enlightenment!

72
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,864
I just want to get out of here
as soon as possible.

73
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,158
-Really?
-Really?

74
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,423
<i>It's hopeless.
<i>They've forgotten about everything.

75
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,551
<i>Their only concern is how to adapt better.

76
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,389
<i>We're going to end up living
<i>at the bottom of this valley forever.

77
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,182
<i>I won't let that happen.

78
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,686
<i>If I get out of here,
<i>I can see that lady...

79
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,397
If you return from the valley,

80
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,649
let me show you a good time.

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,735
<i>No, not that.

82
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,530
<i>I want to fulfill my dream
<i>of traveling the world with Sinbad!

83
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,992
<i>I have to get out of here, no matter what.

84
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,078
Huh?

85
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,416
Holy smokes!

86
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,629
What is it? I want to go back to sleep.

87
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,297
What?!

88
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,591
-Fresh meat?!
-Fresh meat?!

89
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,802
A little rotten,
but it's still mouth-watering meat!

90
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,763
It's lamb, too!

91
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,682
How did this get to the bottom
of the valley?!

92
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,809
Mystras, how did you find this?

93
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,397
I found it on the ground
while searching the area last night.

94
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,068
It was already processed when I found it.

95
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,363
So... that means...

96
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,242
we'll have a lamb feast tonight!

97
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,494
Woo-hoo!

98
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,496
No!

99
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,957
Think about it!

100
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,460
This meat has clearly been processed
by human hands!

101
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,837
Don't you think it's suspicious

102
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,756
that it's here?!

103
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,966
It's not a coincidence!

104
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,677
Someone intentionally placed
the fresh meat here.

105
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,262
It could be a clue to our escape!

106
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,806
I want it rare.

107
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,517
That's too risky. It has to be well-done.

108
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,229
Huh?

109
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,941
What's this rock doing here?

110
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,819
It's a precious stone.

111
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,239
You can find a lot of those here.

112
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,283
But I've been ignoring them
since they're inedible.

113
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,537
You're right. We can't even eat it.

114
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,788
<i>Precious stones...

115
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,833
<i>Even precious stones lost to hunger...

116
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,796
<i>These two are far too comfortable
<i>to ever get out of here.

117
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,675
Mystras.

118
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,053
You've led us
into a game-changing situation.

119
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,266
This may be the decisive blow

120
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,309
that will break the deadlock.

121
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,605
Now, show me where you found this meat.

122
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:44,941
Yes.

123
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,832
Unbelievable.

124
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,710
They weren't here this afternoon.

125
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,669
Yeah.

126
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,214
I wonder who's responsible...

127
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,758
and why.

128
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,353
It's fine meat!

129
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,773
-Gather them all!
-Yes!

130
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,318
Will you quit gathering the meat
and listen for once?!

131
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,654
Of course,
I'm very curious about this meat, too.

132
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,282
But first, we gotta gather them all!

133
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,826
Exactly!

134
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,286
Balalark Meat!

135
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,996
What the heck are you saying?!

136
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,708
Finding out the truth comes first!

137
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,837
This meat might give us a clue
on how to get out of here!

138
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,048
Hey! Give that back!

139
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,049
Don't you dare!

140
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,683
It's those birds of Artemyra!

141
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,353
They're over here, too!

142
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,647
Darn it! That's our meat!

143
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,279
The birds snatched all of them.

144
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,615
No...

145
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,785
That meat could've led us to a way out.

146
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:21,955
Now it's hopeless.

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,836
It's gonna be okay, Mystras.

148
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,172
We've survived up until now.

149
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,926
It seems like fate is on our side.

150
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,101
That's strange.

151
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,397
They're gathering far less stones
than before.

152
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,316
It's the birdies' fault.

153
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,529
So true. They haven't brought us
any meat recently.

154
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,738
No excuses!

155
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,826
But we're trying our best.

156
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,162
So true! You're being tyrannical.

157
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,873
Silence!
Your pay will be commission-based!

158
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,585
So, it will decrease if you can't gather
a sufficient amount!

159
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,794
Oh, no!

160
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,505
If I can't make any money,
my wife will kill me!

161
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,675
Same here, my lady!

162
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,263
Okay, fine! Just focus and keep working!

163
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,348
We'll figure something out on our end.

164
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,895
My lady, you're truly womanly and great!

165
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,647
Women are so reliable!

166
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,650
Hurry!

167
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,529
We gotta gather them all
before the birds take them away again.

168
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,991
Don't leave anything! Let's do this!

169
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,621
<i>He said, "Fate was on our side."

170
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,416
<i>He just wants to eat the<i>meat after all.

171
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,169
<i>I can't trust anyone anymore.

172
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,298
I'm gonna be stuck here forever.

173
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,134
Do not worry, Mystras.

174
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,638
Sin has a plan.

175
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,475
He's the type of man who can...

176
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,103
turn futility into an act of destiny.

177
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,357
So, let's believe in him.

178
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,692
Look at this, guys!

179
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,820
Meat that's not rotten!

180
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,616
I only see a man who wants to eat meat.

181
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,702
It's all in your head, Mystras.

182
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,079
It's all in your head.

183
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,835
This time...

184
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,337
They're gigantic!

185
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,423
They're bigger than ever!

186
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,219
So, what? We still have no way out.

187
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,929
Mystras.

188
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,055
I've been...

189
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,227
waiting for this day to come.

190
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,565
They're the carriers of our destiny!

191
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,823
Good! That should be big enough.

192
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,201
Come back with more precious stones!

193
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,494
Yes, ma'am!

194
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,664
I can't wait! Let's hurry!

195
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,916
Since the meat's bigger,

196
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,752
there's a lot more stones stuck to it.

197
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,592
Hey there.

198
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,101
I'm gonna borrow that cloth.

199
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,104
-Good heavens.
-Please excuse us.

200
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,774
We've been living in nature
for quite some time now.

201
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,653
So, this was why you made us

202
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,655
carve out the meat.

203
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,783
What's this about?

204
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,579
They drop meat into the bottom
of the snake-infested valley

205
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,040
and make the birds pick up
precious stones.

206
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,919
<i>But we started to eat all of that meat.

207
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,547
<i>So, then, they started to think

208
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>that a carnivore wandered
<i>into the bottom of the valley

209
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,136
<i>and kept eating all of the meat.

210
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,849
<i>So, they decided to use
<i>massive-sized pieces of meat

211
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,935
<i>that wouldn't get eaten
<i>before the birds came to retrieve them.

212
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,106
Yup. That's exactly what happened.

213
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,902
I wondered why
I didn't see any men in the city.

214
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,488
But they were forced to work here.

215
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,324
Is it possible...

216
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,868
that you're all treated unfairly
by women?

217
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,203
Unfairly?

218
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,955
Oh, of course not!

219
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,458
We're just homemakers.

220
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,629
Only women are allowed to handle animals
in this country.

221
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,715
Women are the ones in charge of labor.

222
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,011
Yes! Instead, men take on the housework
and protect the home.

223
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,389
We take up side jobs like these, too.

224
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:54,018
Women are busy bees,
working so hard every day.

225
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,229
I totally agree.

226
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:01,192
The roles of women and men are
completely switched in Artemyra society.

227
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,529
I don't understand it at all.

228
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,572
Let's get to work now.

229
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,325
Looks like they're having
a lot of fun though.

230
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,451
All right!

231
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,122
Sinbad, the world is a vast place.

232
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,873
Indeed.

233
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,961
Now, shall we report to the queen

234
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,880
and show her that we survived?

235
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,761
That's all
for today's governmental affairs.

236
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,848
Have a good night, Your Grace, Mira.

237
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,229
How beautiful is this Metal Vessel
that houses the Djinn?

238
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,942
It's a pity I can't demonstrate its power
since it belongs to another.

239
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,988
But nothing else adorns me better.

240
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,114
Adorns you?

241
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,574
You're wrong.

242
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:53,619
Your own beauty overpowers
everything around you.

243
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,997
Sinbad?!

244
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,416
I've returned
from the Valley of the Dead...

245
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,420
to see you.

246
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,008
-I wanted to see you.
-Wait.

247
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,138
Yes, I needed to see you.

248
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,349
Because you had my Metal Vessel.

249
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,896
You're so cautious that you use dolls
to take your place in meetings.

250
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,648
I knew that you would keep
the Metal Vessel

251
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,276
where you can keep your eye on it
at all times.

252
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,530
Your Excellency, is something the matter?

253
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,743
Unforgivable.
I'll never forgive you for this, Sinbad.

254
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,204
I'm going to...

255
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,373
make you regret
how you insulted the queen,

256
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,917
Mira Dianus Artemina.

257
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,962
I'll never let a man get away
with such disrespect.

258
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,090
My servant of sternness and fascination.

259
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,967
Take shelter within me.

260
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,221
Transform my whole body
into that of a great magus.

261
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,474
Cerberus!

262
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,521
Let me show you my powers.

263
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,776
Do you think Sinbad is gonna be okay?

264
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,570
Well, he's reckless as always.

265
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,782
But we must save Hinahoho
as soon as possible.

266
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,116
Ja'far!

267
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,118
Look!

268
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,543
Bararaq!

269
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,378
Bararaq!

270
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,384
Sinbad and the queen are fighting
with Djinn Equips?

271
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,804
The queen's going to use
a lightning Djinn like Baal?

272
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,975
Our lightning might cancel
each other out.

273
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,769
I won't even feel your attacks.

274
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,480
Then may I show you...

275
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,859
the power of the other Djinn?

276
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,115
As I captured several Dungeons
and subdued various Djinns,

277
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,369
I'm able to switch Djinn Equips
and exercise their power.

278
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,497
My servant of deception and confidence.

279
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,001
Transform my whole body
into that of a great magus.

280
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,045
Djinn Equip Valefor!

281
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,340
Another Djinn Equip?

282
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,927
Do you think that trick will work on me?

283
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,933
What are you waiting for?

284
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,768
If you won't attack...

285
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,645
then I will!

286
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,777
What, is that all you've got?

287
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,822
Garufor Zairu!

288
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,324
GARUFOR ZAIRU

289
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,454
A direct hit!

290
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,788
No.

291
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,707
She's unharmed.

292
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,667
Don't make me laugh.

293
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,962
This is the "power"
of a multiple Dungeon Capturer?

294
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,382
Cerberus is a three-headed Djinn.

295
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,136
One governs ice
and the other governs lightning.

296
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,931
And I, the main body, governs fire.

297
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,644
I subdued the ultimate Djinn
that houses three different elements.

298
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,229
I don't need to switch Djinn Equips.

299
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,318
Possessing only two elements,
you cannot defeat me!

300
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,321
I can't believe that such Djinn exists!

301
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,281
There's no way you can win.

302
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,825
At this rate, Sinbad's gonna...

303
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,079
No, let's have faith in him.

304
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,457
Sin must have a plan.

305
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,795
I'll knock you down to the ground!

306
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,881
Cerbero Hadisa!

307
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,007
CERBERO HADISA

308
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,301
Sinbad!

309
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,015
Well, that was close.

310
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,643
But this is the end!

311
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,192
Cerbero Jairu Ranquesa!

312
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,985
CERBERO JAIRU RANQUESA

313
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,574
Sinbad...

314
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,495
How easy.

315
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,833
Guess you were just like
all the other men,

316
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,376
Sinbad.

317
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,923
Your Excellency, I'm not dead yet.

318
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,219
You... How are you here?

319
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
<i>How did he pull this off from that stance?

320
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,727
It's working. Valefor's true powers.

321
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,395
True powers?

322
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,646
<i>Yes.

323
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,357
<i>Valefor manipulates ice and snow,

324
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,360
<i>but that's only part of his true power.

325
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,864
You insolent bastard,
running is all you can do?

326
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,159
But you won't be able to escape this.

327
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,787
Fire, lightning and ice.

328
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:51,250
The ultimate annihilation magic
that combines all three elements.

329
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,919
I'll turn you into ash!

330
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,424
Maximum magic!
Cerbero Kalb Volquesa!

331
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,633
CERBERO KALB VOLQUESA

332
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,345
Impossible!

333
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,765
You cannot do that, Your Excellency.

334
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,393
You'll end up harming the country
that it's your duty to protect.

335
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,606
<i>How is he able to come up behind me?

336
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,359
<i>I never took my eyes off him.

337
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:22,239
Bastard!
I refuse to be dictated to by a man!

338
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,742
I'm over here.

339
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,996
<i>What's happening?
<i>My attacks are completely wasted.

340
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:36,170
<i>It's like fighting someone...
<i>from another dimension.

341
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,757
-The queen's moves...
-Yes.

342
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,384
Valefor's ability is "stagnation."

343
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:48,432
His power to limit the target's movement
is the true ability of that Djinn Equip.

344
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,810
<i>The hail earlier

345
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,521
<i>was created by solidifying water drops

346
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,731
<i>floating in the air.

347
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,694
<i>He then applied the stagnation power
<i>to the queen herself.

348
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,365
<i>It weakened the queen quite a bit.

349
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,868
<i>But she still has no idea...

350
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:19,004
<i>This can't be! This is the first time
<i>in my life a man has...

351
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,550
I prefer not to treat women this way.

352
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,805
Garufor Kirestal!

353
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,603
<i>The first man to ever... defeat me.
