1
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:19,052
This... is the ocean?

2
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:25,492
Sinbad, I was actually frightened.

3
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,696
What if the realities
of the outside world...

4
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,734
disappointed me? What would I do?

5
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,437
But that's all gone now.

6
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,408
I want to know more about the world!

7
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,778
So, where are we heading to next?

8
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,180
Yeah, about that...

9
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,083
We're heading to another small country,
like Sasan.

10
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:55,055
We were finally approved to enter
the most secluded of the secluded regions.

11
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,426
Ruled by a noble war princess,
it's a matrilineal nation.

12
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,096
A municipality of the sky,
the Artemyra Kingdom.

13
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,458
<i>The Artemyra Kingdom is located

14
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,528
<i>in the southeast region of the continent.

15
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:45,499
<i>It is a prominent small country,
<i>comparable to the Sasan Kingdom.

16
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,769
<i>Excluding the Dark Continent,

17
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,772
<i>their territory includes
<i>the world's largest valley.

18
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,842
<i>Everything was obscured
<i>and isolated from the outside world.

19
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,212
<i>Why?

20
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,787
Unreal.

21
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,757
<i>Its vast terrain rejects and discourages

22
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,826
<i>any outside visitors.

23
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,467
Shall we start preparing for landing?

24
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,302
It's huge!

25
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,404
Check out that plant!

26
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,574
But it's so humid.

27
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,348
A bird?

28
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,983
Looks like a bird.

29
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,686
But that bird's a little...

30
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:53,734
It's gigantic.

31
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,703
People?

32
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,512
Impressive size.

33
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,281
It's even wider than this ship.

34
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,417
Look! It's coming back.

35
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,457
Travelers from the outside world?
That's unusual.

36
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,025
Hey there!

37
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,461
What beautiful women...

38
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:25,565
Guys! If you successfully land
in Artemyra,

39
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,968
I'll show you a good time!

40
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:28,935
What?!

41
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,705
We'll see how you fare.

42
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,876
Last time, the men couldn't handle
the all-nighter,

43
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,978
trembling like little fawns.

44
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,682
That's all men are good for
so they might as well work hard at it.

45
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,521
So prove us wrong, will you? Good luck!

46
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,689
Yeah, all right.

47
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:54,961
I'll be looking forward to tonight, then.

48
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,667
Idiot! I wasn't being serious.

49
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,475
Now I'm a lot more excited
to get to Artemyra.

50
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,777
Sinbad, I have a lot more respect for you!

51
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,512
I'll be your follower forever!

52
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,681
Take it easy, Ja'far.

53
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,920
What was that about? He really bugs me.

54
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,055
I thought he was handsome.

55
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,025
Men are all talk anyway!

56
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,061
Let's see if they can make it

57
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,730
through this valley and get to Artemyra.

58
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,337
We gotta pass through this valley today!

59
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,773
Let us discover the Eden of Enchantment!

60
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,808
Yeah! I'm right behind you!

61
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,579
I wouldn't use up all my energy now.

62
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,980
They're full of spirit.

63
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,549
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

64
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,528
<i>Why is this happening?!

65
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,864
It's this way! Let's go!

66
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,668
<i>Curse you,
<i>mountain man and ex-assassin!

67
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,705
I can't do this anymore!
It's hot and I'm exhausted!

68
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,473
I refuse to go any farther!

69
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,809
Ja'far, let's take a break here!

70
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,878
What?! Weren't we going
to pass through the valley today?

71
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,381
Oh, how I envy the young...

72
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,983
You're young, too!

73
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:28,455
Carry me on your back, Hinahoho!
You can carry one or two of me.

74
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,460
Heat... Humidity... Pain...

75
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,098
But I'll endure it...
for my wife and son.

76
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,034
Get it together, let's go!

77
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,676
I'll guide you, so be mindful
of your surroundings and follow me.

78
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,646
Got it, but are you sure?

79
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,049
It's hot and I'm spent...

80
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,685
If he keeps that up...

81
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,555
Don't worry. He's the kind of man
who can do anything.

82
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,758
That's why we cannot spoil him.

83
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,128
Ja'far, you must trust him quite a bit.

84
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,729
You never doubt him.

85
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,433
It's not even about that.

86
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,504
I've seen a lot as his vassal...

87
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,077
<i>I just thought of something brilliant.

88
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,816
I can fly using my Djinn Equip!

89
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,086
Like the ladies
who were flying on that bird!

90
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,990
So, catch you later, fellas!

91
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,797
What was that for, Ja'far?!

92
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,567
Please understand,
we're in Artemyra territory,

93
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,771
where nobody knows
about Djinn Equips or Metal Vessels.

94
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,910
Flying around like that would cause them
to be unnecessarily wary of us.

95
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,546
We'll lose everything!

96
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,515
You're not the only one who's exhausted!

97
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,218
This heat irritates me, too!

98
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,557
Ja'far! That string's too tight!

99
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,825
I'm choking...

100
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,994
Bararaq Sei!

101
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,923
-I'm done.
-Me too. I give up.

102
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,692
Let's take a quick break.

103
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,804
That's...

104
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,676
Artemyra!

105
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,051
The people of this town

106
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,654
live in the tunnels dug into the cliffs.

107
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,622
Yeah.

108
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,328
I see.

109
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,933
They use birds as their main mode
of transportation.

110
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,016
Such a young child...

111
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,320
We face so many unknowns
at our actual destination.

112
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,190
But keep in mind
that we're not here as tourists.

113
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,158
We've exchanged many letters

114
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,195
to be approved for an audience
with the queen.

115
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,765
I would suggest going
to the royal palace now, but...

116
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,602
We stink!

117
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,341
What? An inn? We don't have those here.

118
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,611
We never have any visitors here.

119
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,013
-Oh, no...
-But, guys,

120
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,383
your stench is unbearable!

121
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,119
And that's why I despise men!

122
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:23,156
Well, is there anywhere we can bathe?

123
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,893
You can perform an ablution
in the river at the bottom of the valley

124
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,062
or go to the red-light district.

125
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,131
Red-light district...

126
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,802
I guess we have to go with the ablution.

127
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,339
Ja'far, don't you think
it would be extremely rude of us

128
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:43,877
to appear unwashed
in front of the queen?

129
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,879
So...

130
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,815
-let's go to the red-light district!
-Rejected!

131
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,785
Ja'far! So you're saying
it's okay to stink like this?!

132
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,955
We just arrived!
If you cause any trouble with a lady now,

133
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,724
imagine the consequences!

134
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,393
Hinahoho, the red-light district is

135
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,996
a paradise where you're surrounded
by women, right?

136
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,430
I read about it before!

137
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,066
What in the world were you reading?

138
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:13,673
In any case, do you see all the women
working with such high spirits?

139
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,309
It seems like a good country.

140
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,913
Yes, we hope to establish
a cooperative alliance with them.

141
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:20,880
Yeah.

142
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,853
We'll settle for the ablution for now.

143
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,188
Yes! Let's get it out of the way.

144
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:32,926
Excuse me.

145
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,862
Oh, my, forgive me.

146
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,434
What a big lady...

147
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,875
You've come a long way.

148
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,278
Her Excellency is waiting.
This way, please.

149
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,282
Her Excellency is not in her best mood.

150
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,018
Please be mindful of what you say.

151
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,895
Your Excellency,
we are extremely delighted

152
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,930
for the honor
to have an audience with you.

153
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,001
I am Sinbad,
the proprietor of Sindria Company.

154
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,405
It's an international trading company
based in the Reim Empire.

155
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:24,377
We are here in hopes to establish trade
with your country.

156
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,883
Your Excellency,
do we appear inept in any way?

157
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,187
If something is bothering you...

158
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,998
It's been a while
since I've had male guests.

159
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,376
Go ahead, entertain me.

160
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:03,383
I am Mira Dianus Artemina,
queen of Artemyra.

161
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,154
Far too many visitors have looked down
on me for being a woman.

162
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:13,059
That's why I chastise them from the start.

163
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,530
Every one of you is a man.

164
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,099
In letters prior to this meeting,

165
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,536
the company's advisor was
a woman named Rurumu.

166
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:29,275
She's pregnant right now
so she had to stay behind. Today...

167
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,178
Well, that's a drag. Then leave.

168
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,114
I have no desire to speak to men.

169
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,351
Men are only here to produce
our offspring, that's it.

170
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,321
How can I speak about diplomacy
with such people?

171
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,391
Please, give us a chance.

172
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,326
Enough! I told you to leave.

173
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,396
Please wait, Your Excellency.

174
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,400
I will never betray you.

175
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,904
I only intend to do our best to benefit

176
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,940
this country and Your Excellency.

177
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,046
Please believe me.

178
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,215
Your Excellency.

179
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,090
So, that's how...

180
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,494
you've been seducing women
all over the world, right?

181
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,965
I'm different from other men.

182
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,167
You're wrong.

183
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:34,941
You're not the only one to say
that you're different from other men.

184
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,643
That's... for me to decide.

185
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,081
Seduction is a man's shallow wit.

186
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:48,888
I'll show you the terror you'll face
when you deceive women.

187
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,227
You're mistaken!
We never intended to deceive you.

188
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,262
-Take them away.
-Yes!

189
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,372
Can this woman also be...?!

190
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,043
Oh, so you're also a King's Candidate,
master of a Djinn.

191
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,513
A Metal Vessel sorcerer...

192
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,383
You're not just a boor.

193
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,321
But that still doesn't change the fact
that you offended me.

194
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,359
Hey! We don't know
what the others are hiding!

195
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,994
Strip them all!

196
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,165
-What are you doing?!
-Hey, that's...!

197
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,666
Take everything off! All of it!

198
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:42,975
"Valley of the Dead,"
our country's deepest and darkest.

199
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,512
No one survives this fall.

200
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,215
You shall starve and crumble to dust.

201
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,585
No! I don't want to die here!

202
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:57,023
Oh, my, look how sturdy you look
without any clothes.

203
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,396
If you return from the valley,
let me show you a good time.

204
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,532
But I doubt you can!

205
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,667
What?

206
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,268
What?

207
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,605
Sin! Guys!

208
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,411
He's powerless,
even as a Metal Vessel sorcerer.

209
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,081
You're one of the Imuchakk,
the tribe of the extreme north.

210
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:27,386
We'll be examining
your unusual physique.

211
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,423
You're not trying to dissect me, are you?!

212
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,594
-What a great body.
-So burly...

213
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,529
Look at those muscles!

214
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,535
I'll make you experience something
even more terrifying than death.

215
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,084
Hey, is everyone okay?

216
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,786
Yes, seems like we survived it.

217
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,356
My body hurts all over though!

218
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:07,460
It's a miracle
that we even survived that fall.

219
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,363
We gotta figure out a way back.

220
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,566
That's right! We gotta go back alive!

221
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,269
-Hey, Mystras.
-Yes?

222
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,606
That lady said something before she
pushed you over the cliff, didn't she?

223
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,308
What did she tell you?

224
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,577
What? It was nothing.

225
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,680
No, you're hiding something! I know it!

226
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,116
I'm not hiding anything!

227
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,385
-You are!
-No, I'm not!

228
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,555
-You are! You are!
-No, I'm not! No, I'm not!

229
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,489
Shut it!

230
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:41,427
Why don't you hide those instead?

231
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,095
Hide what?

232
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,098
Those things that
can't be seen on-screen!

233
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,199
Screen?

234
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,573
The leaves aren't settling in place.

235
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,609
You gotta use a vine to keep it in place.

236
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,612
All right! That's perfect.

237
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,616
Is this acceptable, Ja'far?

238
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,453
I guess so...

239
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,223
All right!
Let's get to searching the area!

240
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,592
Yeah!

241
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,230
It sure is the Valley of the Dead.

242
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,534
This is going to be a struggle to capture.

243
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:26,305
The surface of the walls are covered
with moss. It's impossible to climb.

244
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,375
There's no sign of animals either.

245
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,778
There's absolutely no way out.

246
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:40,486
That's right, we haven't eaten anything
since we got to this country.

247
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,725
Actually... I have some emergency food.

248
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,528
Knights of Sasan keep emergency food

249
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,498
in their turbans for times of crisis.

250
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:57,737
It's a custom to prepare for
the eventuality of being held captive.

251
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,172
Please split it between yourselves.

252
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,309
No, this is yours, Mystras.

253
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,177
You should eat one.

254
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,881
-What? But...
-It's okay.

255
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:15,488
I was actually starving to death myself.

256
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,456
Thank you.

257
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,926
Delicious!

258
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,796
Ja'far.

259
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,767
This one's yours.

260
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,904
I can't take any food from you...

261
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,873
the youngest one here.

262
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:35,574
Sin...

263
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,713
Thank you very much, but I'm okay.

264
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:45,718
During my years as an assassin,
I often went days without food.

265
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,653
Sin, you should eat that jer--

266
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,656
Oh, really? Then I'll eat it!

267
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,893
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

268
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,628
He said it was mine.

269
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,432
Can't you follow Ja'far's example?!

270
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,500
Aren't you embarrassed as our leader?!

271
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,616
<i>What's that sound?

272
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,226
Wake up, both of you!
Snakes everywhere!

273
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,599
I see various kinds,
large, small and poisonous.

274
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,568
This is like a swamp of snakes!

275
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,369
What should we do?

276
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,673
Ja'far, Mystras! Live on for me!

277
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,744
I wish I could've chosen
my own place of death.

278
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,613
Surrounded by beautiful women,

279
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,417
delicious food, delicious wine,
and other delicious things...

280
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,319
What are you saying?

281
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,888
-What?
-Good grief.

282
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,458
It's unlike you to spill your guts.

283
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,844
You're only acting weak

284
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,513
because you're hungry.

285
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,682
But that's an easy fix!

286
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:32,291
Let's restore our energy by eating this!

287
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,626
Ja'far...

288
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,561
You're... going to eat that?

289
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,832
I've strangled and eaten many of these
during my assassin years.

290
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,500
It's packed with nutrients,

291
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,670
and as long as we cut the neck,
you can eat the poisonous ones, too.

292
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,440
Let's eat!

293
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,408
Yes!

294
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,945
Take your time, there's plenty of them!

295
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,789
<i>Sinbad and his crew worked
<i>in earnest to survive.

296
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,626
<i>They ate snakes, built fires,

297
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,797
<i>gathered vegetation to construct
<i>a house that kept the rain and wind out.

298
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,533
<i>They worked as the sun rose

299
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,036
<i>and slept when the sun set.

300
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:21,707
<i>While living a life revolved
<i>around the sun,

301
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:25,444
<i>their instincts as animals
<i>were coming back.

302
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,880
<i>They then...

303
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,884
<i>successfully adapted...

304
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,487
<i>to this extreme situation.
