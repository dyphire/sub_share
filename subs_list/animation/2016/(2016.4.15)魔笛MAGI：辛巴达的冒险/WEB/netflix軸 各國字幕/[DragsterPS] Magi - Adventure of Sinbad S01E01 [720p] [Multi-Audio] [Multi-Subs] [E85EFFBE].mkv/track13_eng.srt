1
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,191
You're almost there, Esra.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,395
The head is out. It'll be born soon.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,441
<i>I felt it.

4
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,544
<i>Something just happened now.

5
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,315
Rukh is resonating.

6
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,517
A great power has been...

7
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,486
Born.

8
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,221
On the great earth of the north,

9
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,524
something possessing a great power
has been born.

10
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,205
How interesting.

11
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,442
The birth of a human with such great power

12
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,145
rarely happens in a thousand years.

13
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,547
It's a miracle.

14
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,555
<i>A miracle child with a power.

15
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,797
Esra, you did great.

16
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,336
It's a healthy boy.

17
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,740
His name is Sinbad.

18
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,747
<i>The child who becomes the overlord
<i>of seven seas.

19
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,846
To the victory of our country.

20
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,549
Cheers!

21
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,620
I'm thankful.

22
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:45,459
Since the war started,
we're able to live our lives like this.

23
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,662
When our country wins,
we gain money and land.

24
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,431
It's great to have a war.

25
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,501
Oh, you're here.

26
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,703
We've been looking all over for you.

27
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,338
Mr. Badr.

28
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,317
Here, take this.

29
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,720
Here.

30
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,291
I'm sorry, but I can't accept it.

31
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,496
I don't deserve all this money.

32
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,864
Well, but...

33
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,334
you're a hero who fought
more than anyone else in the war.

34
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,870
You deserve this.

35
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,976
Then why don't I spend it
on everyone's drinks?

36
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,811
I can do that, right?

37
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,680
Wow, did everyone hear that?

38
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,282
We'll drink it up.

39
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,652
Cheers to New Parthevia!

40
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,822
He's giving away his reward.

41
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,391
Right. What a strange guy...

42
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,993
Badr is.

43
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,836
<i>Parthevia was just a small nation
<i>until a few years ago.

44
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:06,540
<i>Now it's rapidly extending
<i>its sphere of influence.

45
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:12,379
<i>And its territory is approaching
<i>the great power, Reim Empire.

46
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,387
<i>Which direction...

47
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,056
<i>is this country going?

48
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,393
<i>I don't want the war anymore.

49
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,898
What I should do now is

50
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,533
catch a lot of fish,

51
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,902
and see her smile.

52
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,817
Pops!

53
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,419
Sinbad.

54
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,421
Why are you here?

55
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,624
-Ocean.
-Sin, careful.

56
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,831
I wasn't paying attention.

57
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,601
You're my proud son.

58
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,743
Pops.

59
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,145
Not this way.

60
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,947
Go that way.

61
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,555
Got it.

62
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,769
We did it, Pops!

63
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,139
Sin...

64
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,510
you might have some special power.

65
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,980
The power to choose the right destiny.

66
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,982
<i>You'll...

67
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,753
<i>guide the people and this country,
<i>which is going in the wrong direction.

68
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,489
You'll be the man who...

69
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,425
changes this world.

70
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,597
Two years later

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,036
We found him. Over there.

72
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,508
We've cornered him.

73
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,943
Surrender.

74
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,210
Drop your weapons.

75
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,981
Hey!

76
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,555
It's a fine day.

77
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,457
I got lots of fish.

78
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,726
Ah, but...

79
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,829
Pops!

80
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,536
Oh, you saved me.

81
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,739
I almost ate all the fish that I caught.

82
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,040
Right.

83
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,509
You're always forgetful.

84
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,245
Sorry about that.

85
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,048
Pops.

86
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,718
Let me on your boat today.

87
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,052
I'm five years old already.

88
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,988
I can help you.

89
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,093
No, I don't think so.

90
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,063
You're mean. Why not?

91
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,765
You'll get in my way.

92
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,667
I can't have a kid on my boat.

93
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,703
Why is that? You're a fool!

94
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,805
I can...

95
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,877
I can be useful to you.

96
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,516
Thank you, Sin.

97
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:41,121
When you're a little older,
I'll let you on the boat all you like.

98
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,592
I'll train you up then.

99
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,929
-Pops.
-Hey, what are you doing?

100
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,034
Am I not allowed to fish?

101
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,770
Allowed to fish?

102
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,640
-How shameless.
-How could you say stuff like that?

103
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,142
Traitor!

104
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,880
<i>The Parthevia Empire
<i>achieved a monumental victory,

105
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,716
<i>and changed its name
<i>to New Parthevia Empire.

106
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,553
<i>Encouraged by its success,
<i>it started a war with Reim Empire.

107
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,890
<i>However, the war situation changed.

108
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:21,728
<i>Financial difficulty led to
<i>the impoverishment of the Parthevians.

109
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:28,001
<i>What remained was the national obsession
<i>to win the war.

110
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:33,840
<i>People have become intolerant of
<i>those who don't cooperate with the war.

111
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:38,678
Hey, everyone's having a hard life
and yet still cooperating with the war.

112
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,981
What's up with you?
How come you're fishing leisurely?

113
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,616
Say something.

114
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,785
Some hero.

115
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,722
You're a traitor
who doesn't cooperate with the war.

116
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,591
Pops!

117
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,065
What's so funny?

118
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,634
Sorry.

119
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,738
You're so passionate about the war.

120
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,141
To be honest,

121
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,311
I'm not interested in anything about
how this country is doing.

122
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,847
"Will it be sunny tomorrow?"

123
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,316
"I want a drink with my dinner."

124
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,252
Honestly, those are the things
I think about.

125
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,622
How dare you!

126
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,830
Pops, Pops.

127
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,967
Wake up, Pops.

128
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,237
-Sin.
-Pops.

129
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,810
-Sin, are you okay?
-Yeah.

130
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,248
The lunch your mom made us is ruined.

131
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,054
It's still good, Sin.

132
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,425
Why? Why is it, Pops?

133
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,761
You're a hero, aren't you?

134
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,198
If you were serious,
you could beat them so easily.

135
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,035
Hey, I don't think I can win the fight.

136
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,837
You're so uncool, Pops.

137
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,239
You're really uncool.

138
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,775
Sin.

139
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,288
Here you go.

140
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,891
Sinbad, what's the matter?

141
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:32,992
Nothing.

142
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,061
I'm done eating.

143
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,865
Sin, the water in the pot is running low.

144
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,266
Can you draw water from the well?

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,903
Even a child like you could do
something like that, right?

146
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,006
Unlike you, I'm a proper man.

147
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,909
Drawing water is a piece of cake.

148
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,844
Oh, my.

149
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,382
Honey, are you okay about all this?

150
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,153
When you retired
you were considered a hero,

151
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,488
but now you're treated like a traitor.

152
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,727
Let people say what they want.

153
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:11,965
-I don't care.
-It's not just your problem.

154
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,000
What about our lives?

155
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,369
We don't have money saved up.

156
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,205
How are we going to live?

157
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,078
Pops!

158
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,117
Sin?

159
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,858
Mister.

160
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,364
You had collapsed by the well.

161
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,532
He found you there.

162
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,769
You would've been dead
if he didn't find you.

163
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,046
Thank you, little boy.

164
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,049
Thank you very much.

165
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,151
Thank you.

166
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,122
I'm a traveling merchant

167
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,224
Darius.

168
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,828
The ship that I was on was shipwrecked.
Next thing I knew I was here.

169
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,265
I can't thank you enough.

170
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,434
That was terrible.

171
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,403
If there's anything we can do for you...

172
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,405
-Honey.
-What?

173
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,407
Our home is tiny.

174
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,975
There'll be somewhere else.

175
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:38,051
Mister, why is your hair yellow?

176
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,553
Sinbad, what are you doing?

177
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,322
It's okay.

178
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,926
Have you ever left this village?

179
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,895
-No.
-I see.

180
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,297
I came from outside of this village,

181
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,500
far away from here, a foreign country.

182
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,903
<i>And outside of this village,

183
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,105
<i>there are people like me,
<i>with different hair colors.

184
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,140
<i>There are different countries
<i>and cultures.

185
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,543
<i>There are lots of different
<i>kinds of people.

186
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,848
There are lots of mysterious fruits
and food that you've never seen.

187
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:12,018
The world is full of things
that you don't know.

188
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,620
Adventure is so much fun.

189
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,391
Is it too difficult for you?

190
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,027
No, I want to hear more.

191
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,398
-But I...
-It's okay.

192
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:29,235
You can stay at our house
until you're cured.

193
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,105
But we're scraping out a living,
day to day.

194
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:36,909
Promise me
that you won't get into trouble.

195
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,316
-Yes.
-Welcome to our house.

196
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:48,955
<i>Ever since, Sinbad listened
<i>to Darius's stories every day.

197
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,558
<i>His stories lasted late into the night.

198
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,328
What kind of story do you want today?

199
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,065
Do you want the story about a country
that's surrounded by ice?

200
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,566
Or...

201
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,270
a desert country burning ablaze?

202
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,572
<i>Darius is knowledgeable.

203
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,409
<i>He's also a good storyteller.

204
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:14,647
<i>Exciting adventure stories
<i>and lyrical old tales.

205
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,550
<i>The world kept expanding.

206
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:21,320
<i>Sinbad's passion and excitement
<i>are stirred.

207
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:26,559
<i>How big the world is,
<i>and how small this village is.

208
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,229
<i>To a child who's never left this village,

209
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:34,133
<i>his stories are like fairy tales.

210
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,078
Good morning.

211
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,515
Here you go.

212
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,685
Oh, you've got your baggage?

213
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,555
Actually, I'm leaving today.

214
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,025
What? You aren't healed up yet.

215
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,462
No, I've rested enough.

216
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,630
I'll never forget your generosity.

217
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,065
Is anybody home?

218
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,568
Yes, I'm coming.

219
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,706
We're searching for a spy from the enemy.

220
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,641
-Hey.
-What?

221
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,978
Is there someone here
besides your husband?

222
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,580
-What?
-Get out of the way.

223
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,616
You!

224
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,522
Mom!

225
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,768
Mister?

226
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,012
Sinbad.

227
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,680
Mom.

228
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,188
What are you looking at?
Clear out of my way.

229
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,491
Why, mister?

230
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,195
You're not the kind of guy
who does something like this.

231
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,032
When you were telling me stories,

232
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,101
you were a good guy.

233
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,670
This is my true self.

234
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,239
I don't care about anything else
but my mission.

235
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,576
Reim Military secret agent, Darius.

236
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,244
That's me.

237
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:29,315
Get money, food,
and a boat ready at the beach.

238
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,483
Right now.

239
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,253
Save my child.

240
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,689
Please, somebody.

241
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,691
Please.

242
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,526
We have nothing to do with it.

243
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,096
We don't want to get involved
with you guys.

244
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,332
Damn it.

245
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,367
Everyone is useless.

246
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,836
Move over, you idiots.

247
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,338
Darius.

248
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,610
Please, let him go.

249
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,112
-Honey.
-Pops!

250
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,381
Darius...

251
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,650
you promised me that time.

252
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,228
I beg you.

253
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,498
Please, let him go.

254
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,437
The information that you have

255
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,406
will be very useful to our military.

256
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,675
If you surrender and join Parthevia,

257
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:33,179
your life will be saved. Please.

258
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,382
Betraying my country to save my life?

259
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:41,420
My mission is to serve my country,
and lead my country to victory.

260
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,557
I'm a proud Reim citizen.

261
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,626
I'll never betray my country,
even if I die.

262
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,629
I'm not a traitor like you.

263
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:50,696
Sin!

264
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:03,242
I don't care if I'm called a traitor,
or how much people mock me.

265
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,746
However...

266
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,815
anyone who harms my family

267
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,717
will not be tolerated.

268
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:26,932
You...

269
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,435
scoundrel.

270
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,939
Mister, I liked...

271
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:38,611
your adventure stories.

272
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,347
I liked them.

273
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,750
Shut up.

274
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,253
You kiddo.

275
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,724
<i>Badr of Tison Village.

276
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,592
<i>You're charged with harboring a spy.

277
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,495
<i>You'll be sent to military headquarters
<i>in the capital.

278
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,734
Look, here he comes.

279
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,569
It's terrible.

280
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,371
Are those scars from being tortured?

281
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,306
He'll be sent to the battlefield.

282
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,779
Get up now.

283
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,216
Pops!

284
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,218
Pops!

285
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,287
Honey.

286
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,390
Esra, Sin.

287
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,225
Get out of here.

288
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,260
Get out now.

289
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,662
She's right. Traitor!

290
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,232
You let that spy come here.

291
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,333
Right.

292
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,503
Traitor. Get out of this village.

293
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,539
Stop... Stop it!

294
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,608
Don't say bad things about Pops!

295
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,009
Shut up.

296
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,679
The kid of a traitor.

297
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,614
Don't harm him.

298
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:54,353
Don't harm my son.

299
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,656
Don't harm my family.

300
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,325
Pops.

301
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,660
Listen, guys.

302
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,662
I'm going to war now.

303
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,664
However...

304
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,433
I want you to remember...

305
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,869
what that means.

306
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,304
Look. This is...

307
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,409
what war is.

308
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,748
On the battlefield,
I watched millions of people get hurt...

309
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,984
and die.

310
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,787
Do you still want to...

311
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,557
send your families to war?

312
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:39,331
Hey... you think war is a good thing?

313
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,468
Damn. Take him away now.

314
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,436
Honey.

315
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,940
Sinbad.

316
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,576
Fight if you're a man.

317
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,713
Take care of your mom for me.

318
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,723
<i>Sinbad learned...

319
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,793
<i>the true strength of his father.

320
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:12,431
<i>The important lesson that he taught him,
<i>risking his life.

321
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,968
<i>A few months later,

322
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,737
<i>they were notified of Badr's death.

323
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:23,709
<i>His sword was in the casket
<i>that was sent to them,

324
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,445
<i>but his body was never returned.

325
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,782
<i>Nine years have passed since then.
