1
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,394
Garufor Zairu!

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,235
Don't make me laugh.

3
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,613
This is the "power"
of a multiple Dungeon Capturer?

4
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,615
This is the end!

5
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,993
Cerbero Jairu Ranquesa!

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,332
Sinbad...

7
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,419
I'm not dead yet.

8
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,338
You...

9
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,591
You insolent bastard,
running is all you can do?

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,594
But you won't be able to escape this.

11
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,974
The ultimate annihilation magic
that combines all three elements.

12
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,852
Maximum magic!
Cerbero Kalb Volquesa!

13
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:04,648
Impossible!

14
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,025
You cannot do that, Your Excellency.

15
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,654
You'll end up harming the country
that it's your duty to protect.

16
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,156
I refuse to be dictated to by a man!

17
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,284
I'm over here.

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,830
<i>What's happening?
<i>My attacks are completely wasted.

19
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:25,043
<i>It's like fighting someone...
<i>from another dimension.

20
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,422
I prefer not to treat women this way.

21
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,801
Garufor Kirestal!

22
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,599
<i>The first man to ever... defeat me.

23
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,034
Sinbad, Her Excellency is expecting you.

24
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,584
Ja'far, are we gonna be executed?

25
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,753
We've come all this way.

26
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,839
I just can't die here!

27
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,133
Calm down, Mystras.

28
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,342
But...

29
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,054
Your Excellency, they are present.

30
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,311
Where were you?
I was getting tired of waiting.

31
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,397
Oh, my--!

32
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,485
Your Excellency,
to have an audience with you once again

33
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,362
is a great honor.

34
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,368
Enough of that.
Do you think you can get away with this?

35
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,537
My skin was scarred

36
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,456
from yesterday's battle.

37
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,875
My beautiful body is ruined.

38
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,880
But it's been a long time
since I felt such excitement.

39
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:20,886
You're the first man to ever pin me down
and defeat me, Sinbad.

40
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,348
Last night was unforgettable for me, too.

41
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,607
At this time, the decision has been made

42
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,652
for Artemyra to officially join hands
with Sindria Trading Company.

43
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,157
As queen, this is the first time
I've formed a contract with a company.

44
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,704
I reread the terms of trade
that were proposed in the letter.

45
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,915
It's not a bad deal.

46
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,795
I will dispatch a diplomat
from our country to your company.

47
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,089
We will collaborate as much as we can.

48
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,928
As our isolated country flourishes
with more commerce,

49
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,347
the lives of our citizens
will be enriched.

50
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,726
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

51
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,354
I'm speaking now from a public position.

52
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,648
The truth is,

53
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,568
I don't want you as an enemy, Sinbad.

54
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,073
Even with such great powers,
you devote yourself as a merchant.

55
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,827
What are you trying to do
by coming out here?

56
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,579
What is your true agenda?

57
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,293
Your Excellency, I have a dream
that must be realized.

58
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,963
When you held that Metal Vessel,

59
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,549
didn't you sense the weight of its power?

60
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,679
My duty as the King Vessel,
recognized by the Djinn,

61
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,890
is to create a world without war.

62
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,477
And I need your help,
your cooperation to make it happen.

63
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,188
A world without war?

64
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,190
Yes.

65
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,571
This Metal Vessel will trigger a new war

66
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,949
that will threaten
the equilibrium of the world.

67
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,288
In order to prevent and be prepared
for such a situation,

68
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:16,084
I must share ideologies with powerful
figures like you to establish an alliance.

69
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,089
That's how we can achieve
a "world of acceptance."

70
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,344
You're asking Artemyra to join
that world of acceptance?

71
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,348
So far, I've already formed an alliance
with Rametoto of Imuchakk

72
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,810
and Darius, the Knight-King of Sasan.

73
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,857
You formed an alliance with countries
that ban foreigners?

74
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:45,071
This is Mystras Leoxses,
the son of the Knight-King.

75
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,950
He travels with us
as a representative of Sasan.

76
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,496
Sasan is not a wealthy country either.

77
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,709
I'm sure the Knight-King would've
eventually invaded neighboring countries

78
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,419
to expand his territory.

79
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,300
The immense power of the Metal Vessel
makes conquering nations a piece of cake.

80
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,219
But he lost, didn't he?

81
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,556
He was defeated by you, like I was.

82
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,561
<i>If you wanted to,
<i>you could destroy a whole country.

83
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:22,734
<i>The Knight-King must have surrendered to
<i>your power and agreed to form an alliance.

84
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,615
Sasan has an established relationship
with Reim, too.

85
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,827
If the legendary sorceress of Reim knew
about the Metal Vessel,

86
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,704
things could've been very different.

87
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,415
The "legendary sorceress" of Reim?

88
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,337
You must know
if you're a merchant of Reim.

89
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,549
We're not familiar with Reim territory,
aside from Napolia.

90
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,220
The legendary sorceress of Reim...

91
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:55,183
<i>devoted herself to Reim,
<i>supporting the empire's prosperity.

92
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,852
<i>She's a sorcerer
<i>who's lived for 200 years.

93
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,772
<i>A legendary "Magi."

94
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,067
Two hundred years?

95
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,902
A legendary Magi?

96
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,031
Excuse my ignorance, but what is a Magi?

97
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,327
It's still an obscure existence.

98
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,206
<i>But they appear in legends
<i>all over the world.

99
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,542
<i>They've appeared during crucial times
<i>in history

100
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,087
<i>to guide the lives of many
<i>and enlighten the world.

101
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,257
<i>They are the great sorcerers of creation,

102
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,594
<i>with a special calling
<i>as the "selectors of the king."

103
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,555
That's the Magi.

104
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,307
<i>Magi...

105
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,477
<i>The Magi possess power
<i>beyond human understanding.

106
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:45,442
<i>When they swing their wand, a tower
<i>appears where the king's power is stored.

107
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,154
<i>They have the ability to guide
<i>the chosen one as the king.

108
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,741
<i>We think that these Dungeons
<i>appearing all over the world

109
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,618
<i>are the towers mentioned in the legend.

110
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,582
<i>Magi... Dungeon...

111
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,586
<i>Yunan?

112
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,465
<i>Can he be a Magi?

113
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,593
<i>I always thought he was a strange guy.

114
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:16,931
Your Excellency,
what kind of person is the Magi?

115
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,559
I've told you already.

116
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,770
They are still a mystery.

117
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,439
But if I were to say anything,

118
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,693
I believe Magi are those
who are blessed by the "Rukh."

119
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,195
Rukh?

120
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,823
<i>The Rukh are the headwaters of life

121
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,867
<i>that flow through this world.

122
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,288
Magi that are blessed by Rukh...

123
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,500
could be the embodiment
of our world's will.

124
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,088
That could explain why the Dungeons

125
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,716
are appearing all over the world
and how we're both Capturers.

126
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:56,679
There might be some force
that's influencing this to happen.

127
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:02,102
In any case, you're the only man
I've ever approved of.

128
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,354
Let's form an alliance.

129
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,608
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

130
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,658
I'm relieved
that it worked out peacefully.

131
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:21,371
I got concerned when you started
to fight with your Djinn Equip.

132
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,832
It turned out to be okay.

133
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,752
This is exactly what happened in Sasan!
We were worried sick!

134
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,838
Can't you understand that by now?!

135
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,341
So, we're leaving tomorrow, right?

136
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,677
Yes, that's the plan.

137
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,097
Does that mean
we have free time until then?!

138
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,016
Sure, that's no problem.

139
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,852
But are you all right?

140
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,188
What? What? I'm fine.

141
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,274
What are you hiding?

142
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,984
Nothing!

143
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,070
I'm not about to have a good time
with a lady.

144
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,780
You're the worst liar!

145
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,490
Explain in detail!

146
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,993
I told you that I wasn't!

147
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,369
Tell me!

148
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,370
Never!

149
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,206
Hey, aren't you the boy from before?

150
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,459
So, you really did survive
the Valley of the Dead.

151
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,795
The queen was very impressed,

152
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,881
praising you all for having backbone.

153
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,800
Is that true?!

154
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,178
I'm so glad I made it out alive for you,
my lady!

155
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,932
Do you want your reward that badly?

156
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,892
Yes!

157
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,852
How adorable.

158
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,146
He was so desperate

159
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,982
to escape the valley

160
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,526
for this reason?!

161
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:39,073
<i>I think I'm forgetting
<i>about something very important.

162
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,036
By the way, we're going to release
the other man who was in our custody.

163
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,330
We're reluctant to let him go...

164
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,091
Hinahoho?

165
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,845
Imuchakk man, you're welcome back anytime!

166
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,264
It was a pleasure to have you!

167
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:08,019
He was extremely cooperative
with our research!

168
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,190
It felt great--
No, you were a great help!

169
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,317
Thanks a lot, Hinahoho.

170
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,027
Hinahoho...

171
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,695
How about Rurumu?

172
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,697
I'm not a bad person!

173
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,033
I swear I didn't cross that line...

174
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,536
-Hina...
-I didn't do anything wrong!

175
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,749
Hinahoho!

176
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,419
You were having that much fun while
we were trying to survive in the valley?!

177
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,380
That's just cruel! So cruel of you!

178
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,965
I'm the one who wanted

179
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:41,344
to do this and that with a beautiful lady!
How could you?!

180
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,888
Mystras, stop crying.

181
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,933
What happened to Hinahoho was beyond us.

182
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,894
Focus on how we still have a future.

183
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,064
Sinbad...

184
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,692
The road was already laid out for us.

185
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,822
Remember the heavenly place that
stimulates our most intellectual desires?

186
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,408
Yes, our harem...

187
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,244
The red-light district!

188
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,790
Are there beautiful ladies
in the red-light district?

189
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,916
Yeah, of course!

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,836
Can we have fun with the ladies
in the red-light district?!

191
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,795
Of course we can!

192
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,839
I'll follow you for the rest of my life!

193
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,383
All right! Follow me!

194
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,429
So, we are going
to the red-light district after all.

195
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,390
I did nothing wrong.
I did nothing wrong.

196
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,357
Hello there!

197
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,447
-Thank you for waiting.
-Yes!

198
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,866
Is this your first visit?

199
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,577
We strive to offer you only the best.

200
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,912
Please enjoy our wonderful men

201
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,706
to your heart's content!

202
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,682
Good morning.

203
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,352
I will be joining you, starting today.

204
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,938
I'm Parsine Pratemia, the diplomat.

205
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,483
As a representative of the alliance

206
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,652
and a structural agent
to organize commerce,

207
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,905
I will do my best work
as part of your team.

208
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,950
What's the matter with them?

209
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,453
Oh, don't mind them.

210
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,914
Macho fest...

211
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,958
Quit it, Mystras.
I want to forget that image.

212
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,588
Well, if they're not feeling well,

213
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,090
we can head out tomorrow?

214
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,841
-Please let us leave today!
-Please let us leave today!

215
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:51,391
They will take us to the boat
docked at sea.

216
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,269
It's time to say goodbye
to Artemyra for a while.

217
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,565
Yeah... A lot happened
while we were here.

218
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,568
Not a lot of time has passed,

219
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,614
but it feels like I've been here
for quite some time.

220
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,534
So, you're leaving today.

221
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,870
Who's going to entertain me now?

222
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,457
I regret to see you leave.

223
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,126
Your Excellency!

224
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,504
What an honor to see you here.

225
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:22,755
Don't worry.

226
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,300
I'm fond of you all, that's all.

227
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,264
You might be taking care
of my daughters in the future,

228
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,558
so I wanted express my salutations.

229
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,396
Knowledge of world affairs is crucial
to protect our country in the future.

230
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,149
So, I want you to expand their knowledge.

231
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,735
But that's still way ahead in the future.

232
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,737
What?!

233
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,366
Aren't they cute? They're my daughters.

234
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,745
Your Excellency, you are truly blessed
to have so many children.

235
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,582
It's quite common in our country.

236
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,543
I also have... another one.

237
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,170
What--?

238
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,468
You must be her favorite.

239
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,972
Her name is Pisti,
the youngest of them all.

240
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,142
She can already take control
of our giant birds.

241
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,768
She's one of our strongest.

242
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,313
I'm excited about her future.

243
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,483
-For me?
-Yup.

244
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:35,244
That feather represents the Rukh Bird
of luck in our country.

245
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,373
Sinbad, I sincerely hope

246
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,126
that your journey will be blessed
by the Rukh.

247
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:46,923
Yes!

248
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,728
Mother, I...

249
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,565
smelled the great ocean on that man.

250
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,152
Pisti never met anyone like that before.

251
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,655
I know.

252
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,408
Your mother's never encountered
a man like that before either.

253
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,207
<i>Let us bear witness
<i>to how this man will...

254
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,793
<i>change the world.

255
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,431
Sindria Trading Company
thrives again today!

256
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:38,849
Everyone!

257
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,685
President Sinbad!

258
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,436
You've returned.

259
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,066
I apologize for my long absence.

260
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,195
I need to speak to Rurumu,
to get updated on our current situation.

261
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,866
Since it's her last month of pregnancy,
she's currently back home.

262
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,994
How is Rurumu?

263
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,371
Healthy and full of spirit.

264
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,748
Both her and her baby.

265
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,458
What a relief.

266
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,255
So, he must be taking Rurumu's place...

267
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,343
Hey, Vitte--

268
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,770
-Oh, man.
-Vittel.

269
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,024
Sin?! You're back!

270
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,944
Yup. Thanks for taking care of the company
while I was gone.

271
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,613
It must've been busy.

272
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,114
Thanks a lot.

273
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,158
Sin...

274
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,163
So... take care of those bills for me!

275
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:46,459
But I thought we already took care
of travel expenses...

276
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,253
What do you mean? I've returned.

277
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,714
So, that means...

278
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,049
Exactly.

279
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,468
Time for a banquet!

280
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,348
Let me introduce you all
to our newest members.

281
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,475
Mystras of Sasan.

282
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,479
He's the son of the Knight-King of Sasan,
a great knight himself.

283
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,897
Nice to meet you!

284
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,941
We also have Parsine of Artemyra.

285
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,111
She serves as a diplomat of Artemyra.

286
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,990
They represent Sasan and Artemyra
respectively, and symbolize...

287
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,493
our friendships with each nation.

288
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,454
Please welcome our new comrades.

289
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,666
Mystras is also single, by the way!

290
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,167
Hey!

291
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:32,505
Parsine is scary when she gets mad,
so try not to get on her bad side.

292
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,966
All right, everyone!

293
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,096
Sindria Company will only continue
to expand.

294
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,391
Sasan, Artemyra and Imuchakk,

295
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,353
these three countries are
our reliable allies,

296
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,771
allowing us to have a future.

297
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,233
Our workload and personnel
will continue to increase.

298
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,735
But I believe that we can handle it.

299
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,406
Sindria Trading Company
will become Napolia's--

300
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,284
No. Reim's leading company!

301
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,121
Let's create our nation!

302
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,415
For the ideal future!

303
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,666
Yeah!

304
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,850
Sin... what's the matter?

305
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,812
Everyone wants to talk to you.

306
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,733
Sindria Trading Company
has come a long way.

307
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,947
Yes, we've become
a prominent company of Napolia.

308
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,328
I believe it's all because
of the people we've met so far.

309
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,293
<i>Each and every encounter was essential.

310
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,800
<i>We made it here because of our comrades.

311
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,228
<i>I feel like there's a great force

312
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,690
<i>that's drawing us together.

313
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,536
<i>I see it.

314
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,210
<i>I see it all.

315
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,380
<i>I know where I'm going.

316
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:43,339
<i>I... am special.

317
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,763
<i>Sinbad was only 16 years old at the time.

318
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:55,267
<i>Destiny swept him
<i>and those around him

319
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,770
<i> up in a great big swell.

320
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,524
<i>The world was about to face

321
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,985
<i>an unexpected future of change.
