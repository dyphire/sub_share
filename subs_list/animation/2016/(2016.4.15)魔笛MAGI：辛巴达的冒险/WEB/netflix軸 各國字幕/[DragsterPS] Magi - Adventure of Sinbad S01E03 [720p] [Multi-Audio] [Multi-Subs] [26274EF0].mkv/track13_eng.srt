1
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:22,155
A sight I've never seen.
Mysterious monsters.

2
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,193
Humid and warm air.

3
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,762
This is the Dungeon.

4
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,082
Darn it!

5
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,095
Don't fall out of line.

6
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,697
Move forward along the cliff.

7
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,240
What the heck?

8
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,077
All hundred soldiers
gone in a flash.

9
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,220
Of all places...

10
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,689
Come on, you monster.

11
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,241
You are...

12
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,279
This way.

13
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,848
Hurry.

14
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,526
How did you get inside the Dungeon
before me?

15
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,495
I thought I was the first one here.

16
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,831
You're that pacifist kid.

17
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,667
-Go mind your own business.
-What?

18
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,369
I'm a soldier.

19
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:19,773
I've no reason to be helped by
a traitor who's against our nation.

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,676
I don't care about stuff like "reasons."

21
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,811
What happened already
can't be changed.

22
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,913
Besides...

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,384
I saved you and you don't even thank me.

24
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,319
Who's the kid here?

25
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,554
You're calling me a kid?

26
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:38,859
Fine. I'll explain in a way so a mere
commoner like you would also understand.

27
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,362
Make a note of my noble name.

28
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,666
A general of Parthevia,
the youngest of the Dragul family.

29
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:50,270
A son of General Draguliel Henrius
Nomidus Pertegomidus.

30
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,472
Commander of the Western Region
military unit.

31
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,243
Dragul Nol Henrius Govius Menudias
Partenuvonomias

32
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,412
Dumid Os Kartanon.

33
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,550
It's too long.
Let's do Drakon for short.

34
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,754
You're Drakon, okay?

35
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,357
-You're rude!
-It's way too long!

36
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,358
My name is...

37
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,527
S-I-N-B-A-D, only six letters!

38
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,863
How dare you insult the Dragul name.
I'm going to kill you!

39
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,377
It seems like...

40
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,879
There's no time to be fooling around.

41
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,787
Look how big it is!

42
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,659
Yeah, like a king of the dragons.

43
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,964
That thing just ate all the ones
it didn't like.

44
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,301
The dragon king behaves
just like the human king.

45
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,703
Watch your mouth, commoner!

46
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,742
If we want to forge ahead,
we have to take that thing down.

47
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,679
This is the place
where people fight for their lives.

48
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,348
We're being tested, too.

49
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,752
<i>Being tested, huh?

50
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,623
Sinbad is your name, correct?

51
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,359
You've earned the honor
of becoming my subordinate.

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,430
Act as a decoy to draw its attention.

53
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,466
Meanwhile, I'll approach the door.

54
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:30,537
Our determination to completing
a mission, no matter the sacrifice,

55
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,572
is being tested here.

56
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:36,576
-Go forth.
-Don't impose yourself on me.

57
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,546
A commoner like you
can be of use to the country.

58
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,947
Be honored.

59
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,683
I'll arrange a reward if you die.

60
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,319
That's enough.

61
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,855
You're a real military freak.

62
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:52,592
How many people do you think
have gone to die like that?!

63
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,865
Don't flinch or flee.

64
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,802
Sacrifice your life for your country.

65
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,304
That's our honor
as Parthevian soldiers.

66
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,475
Dying for our country is our true wish.

67
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,572
<i>These geysers are a nuisance.

68
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,608
<i>It's impossible to predict
<i>where they'll shoot out from.

69
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,878
<i>And all these baby dragons.

70
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,655
<i>All I need to do is
<i>pass through the door...

71
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,466
I did it. I made it here.

72
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,803
Door, open for me.

73
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,006
Open!

74
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:20,480
Why? Why not?

75
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,789
Open. Open, open.

76
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,091
Open!

77
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,073
No way. No freaking way.

78
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,842
I will...

79
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,144
accomplish my mission.

80
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,014
No!

81
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,549
I don't want to...

82
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,184
die yet!

83
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,895
Royal princess of the Parthevia Empire,
Your Royal Highness Serendine.

84
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,164
The eldest son of General Dragul,

85
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,533
Lieutenant Barbarossa.

86
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,602
Congratulations.

87
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,705
Your engagement will be the first step

88
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,207
towards the glory of our Parthevia Empire.

89
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,845
Great work, my brother.

90
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,748
You idiot!

91
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,551
Hey, pull yourself together.

92
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,954
Get up, or you'll die.

93
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,164
Kill me.

94
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,901
Kill me.

95
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,137
Afraid of enemies and clinging to life.

96
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,007
I've failed as a soldier.

97
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,976
Nonsense.

98
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,078
"Don't flinch or flee."

99
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,780
"Sacrifice your life for your country?"

100
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,984
What's embarrassing
about not wanting to die?

101
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,952
It's normal.

102
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,155
You're a human before a soldier.

103
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,125
Has the emperor or the military

104
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,160
ever saved the people

105
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,997
who made sacrifices for their country?

106
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,133
A country exists

107
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,570
to protect the people who live in it.

108
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,706
Not to send those people into war to die.

109
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,944
A country that abandons
its people is worthless.

110
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,023
I'm taking this.

111
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,592
Hey, you!

112
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,729
Can you hear that, Drakon?

113
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,633
Sacrifices have been made
for those with power.

114
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,836
This is the sound of their retribution.

115
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,928
It's open.

116
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,196
Let's go.

117
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,067
Who exactly are you?

118
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,837
You are asking me who I am?

119
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,340
I'm me.

120
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,942
Sinbad, the sailor.

121
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,955
<i>Sinbad.

122
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,224
<i>A mysterious man.

123
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,261
<i>He might appear to be a reckless fool,

124
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:05,665
<i>but he carefully analyzes each situation,

125
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,335
<i>and makes the right choice
<i>under any circumstances.

126
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,676
<i>A man who rides the wave of fate.

127
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,817
You still look pale.

128
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,220
Huh, you're out of breath.

129
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,956
Your legs seem tired
after all that fleeing.

130
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,458
Thanks to an idiot,
I had to run around even more.

131
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,364
I praise you for doing so well
for a commoner.

132
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,735
I thought you were just a spoiled kid,
but you're tougher than expected.

133
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,971
Not as much as I am, though.

134
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,040
Those are my words.

135
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,446
They're all made of stone.

136
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,016
I don't see anything unusual here.

137
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,054
I'll have to disagree with that.

138
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,272
My name is Baal.

139
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,141
A genie of wrath and heroism.

140
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,844
Who's the one to be the king?

141
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,281
<i>Is this what Yunan was talking about?

142
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,782
<i>The power to become the king?

143
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,286
<i>The power which
<i>the sorcerers talked about.

144
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,455
<i>If I could offer this to the emperor...

145
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,092
-That's...
-The one to become the king is...

146
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,094
-me!
-me!

147
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,798
Don't get in my way, Drakon.

148
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,969
I'm here by the emperor's direct order.

149
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,404
Back off.

150
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,106
Forget the emperor.

151
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:58,077
I won't give any more power to someone
who tramples all over his people.

152
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,113
I've decided.

153
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,849
With my own power...

154
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,418
I will change this country and the world.

155
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,989
It seems like we'll have to
settle this first after all.

156
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,126
I owe you one for saving me.

157
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,963
However, first and foremost,
I'm a Parthevian soldier.

158
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,366
I won't change my will.

159
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,170
The skill of my future master...

160
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,539
Show me what you've got.

161
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,345
You're pretty good, but...

162
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,520
Sinbad, you're certainly strong.
However...

163
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,391
you're no match for me!

164
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,397
Adios.

165
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,442
Sure, you're better at using a sword.

166
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,010
However...

167
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,447
We're not competing in swordsmanship.

168
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,154
I'm losing consciousness, but...

169
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,060
I will succeed in capturing the Dungeon.

170
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,531
I will never disgrace your name,
Miss Serendine.

171
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,573
Don't be so serious.
You'll get frown lines.

172
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:38,378
Besides, people call me
the venomous spider princess.

173
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,380
How could my name be disgraced?

174
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,050
I like my nickname.

175
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,920
Cast a net, weaken the opponent
and capture it securely.

176
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,356
A spider that never lets go
of its prey.

177
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,392
Just like me.

178
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,597
I'm more persistent than you think.

179
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,599
So Dragul...

180
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,201
You're not allowed to die.

181
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,342
I can't lose.

182
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,478
I haven't lost, yet.

183
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,650
Not yet.

184
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,086
Not yet.

185
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,494
Brother, Miss Serendine

186
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,696
is beautiful, smart and strong-willed.

187
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:35,334
She'll get along with you.

188
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,203
Junior.

189
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,339
I think you're misunderstanding something.

190
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,643
This engagement
is an absurd political move.

191
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,711
This country is in decline.

192
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:50,316
This is simply a way to rebuild it
with the backing of the Dragul family.

193
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,418
That means your feelings
towards her are...

194
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,353
There's no love.

195
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,291
<i>I couldn't say anything.

196
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,159
<i>I couldn't do anything.

197
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,662
<i>I couldn't protect her.

198
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,664
<i>I'm in love with her,

199
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,300
<i>but I couldn't tell her.

200
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,469
<i>How disappointing.

201
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,143
I'm...

202
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,278
I'm disappointed by my weakness.

203
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,249
But she is the one I want to protect.

204
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,684
That's why...

205
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,287
I understand that, because I...

206
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,691
I have many reasons why I can't lose.

207
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,227
That's why...

208
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,070
-I can't...
-I can't...

209
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,547
-I can't lose!
-I can't lose!

210
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,025
My win.

211
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,198
I've witnessed it.

212
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,234
I approve you to be my master.

213
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,769
Take this.

214
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:22,174
This is the power you so desired.

215
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,247
FIRST DUNGEON: BAAL

216
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,716
CAPTURE COMPLETE

217
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,199
Job well done, young Capturer.

218
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,404
Now hand over the treasure
and the Dungeon's power.

219
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,472
I'm not like you guys.

220
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,076
I earned the treasure and the power.

221
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,111
I'll never hand them over to you.

222
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,615
What? That's an act
of rebellion against the empire.

223
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:03,716
Get him.

224
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,189
Are you not going to use your power?

225
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,259
-Yunan.
-I see.

226
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,696
You don't know how to
use the power, yet.

227
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,835
It's quite soon to require my aid,
isn't it Master?

228
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,371
-It's a blue giant.
-What is that?

229
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,672
Is it a monster?

230
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:30,376
Go ahead. Follow the voice of your heart.

231
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,746
Oh, genie of wrath and heroism.

232
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,449
I order you and your messengers...

233
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,651
Using my magic as your source,

234
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,354
bestow my will with great power.

235
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,724
Come forth, Baal.

236
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,399
<i>This is my power?

237
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,767
Sinbad.

238
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,405
Yunan, what are you...?!

239
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,407
This is a gift from me.

240
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,446
What the...?

241
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,426
I've never flown like tha--!

242
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,661
Sin?

243
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,463
It is you!

244
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,198
I'm back.

245
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,834
-Where have you been?
-I was at the Dungeon...

246
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,804
Where could you have gone
leaving Esra for two months?!

247
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,723
Honey.

248
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,725
Is that you?

249
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,493
Badr?

250
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,631
If I'm able to see you...

251
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,767
I must be leaving the world soon.

252
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,738
Hey, our little boy, Sin

253
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:10,342
took your sword and set out
on an adventure.

254
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,812
He's full of energy,

255
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,748
curious, and always so reckless.

256
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,686
But he values his family and friends.

257
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,991
He's very kind and looks just like you.

258
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,761
He's an adult now.

259
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,665
He should be okay.

260
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,869
I love you, Sin.

261
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,840
You found it, right?

262
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,375
Something only you can do.

263
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,780
Do what you must do.

264
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,250
I'll be fine.

265
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,669
<i>Thereafter...

266
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,874
<i>Sinbad's name became known
<i>all across Parthevia.

267
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,677
<i>The news that the Dungeon,
<i>challenged by more than 10,000,

268
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,715
<i>had been captured by a 14-year-old child,

269
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,752
<i>cheered up the war-worn citizens.

270
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,957
<i>On the other hand, the fact that
<i>it was captured by a civilian child

271
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,662
<i>made the palace think bitterly
<i>of this little hero.

272
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:42,568
-Stop it.
-You're Sinbad, aren't you?

273
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,437
I'm glad a pretty girl like you
knows who I am.

274
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,772
Shut up.

275
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,910
You can't beat me.

276
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,881
I'm taking you as a hostage.

277
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:57,449
Princess!

278
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,520
Darn it. Let me down.

279
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:03,589
How dare you?!

280
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,959
How could you embarrass
a royal princess like me?

281
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,900
-What?
-The soldiers will come collect you.

282
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,537
Good job on being a hostage, cutie.

283
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,808
Never! I'll never forgive you.

284
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,810
Sinbad!

285
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,480
Now, let's go.

286
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,617
I'm going to change the world!
