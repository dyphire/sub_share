# VobSub index file, v7 (do not modify this line!)
# 
# To repair desyncronization, you can insert gaps this way:
# (it usually happens after vob id changes)
# 
#	 delay: [sign]hh:mm:ss:ms
# 
# Where:
#	 [sign]: +, - (optional)
#	 hh: hours (0 <= hh)
#	 mm/ss: minutes/seconds (0 <= mm/ss <= 59)
#	 ms: milliseconds (0 <= ms <= 999)
# 
#	 Note: You can't position a sub before the previous with a negative value.
# 
# You can also modify timestamps or delete a few subs you don't like.
# Just make sure they stay in increasing order.
