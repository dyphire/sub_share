Timed to fit [ReinForce] Girls und Panzer Das Finale 03 (BDRip 1920x1080 x264 FLAC) [nyaa.si/view/1470811]

Franken-muxed OP subs from [AK-Submarines] GIRLS und PANZER das FINALE - 02v2 [nyaa.si/view/1226774]

.ass file has embedded fonts, so it’s a bit big.

As you’d probably expect, use mpv [https://mpv.io/] for best playback.

v2 Changelog:

- Accidentally uploaded the wrong subs LE WHOOPS (thank you @arvon2)
- Repositioned English translation sub around the translated credits so you can now read the both of them without overlap.
- Changed “Black Forest” to “Kuromorimine” because while this is the literal translation, it's a proper name, and I've never seen it localized like that. Personal choice.
- at 0:43:10.34 "Duck" was switched to "Mallard" as they are different teams. (nice catch @Marmotzel)

Seem to be working so far, let me know if there's any issues in the comment thread.
